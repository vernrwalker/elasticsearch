# This pickle creator function was developed for the Legal Apprentice workflow,
# written by John Milne, 10/17/2019

# This function takes the JSON-formatted data in /Data that the Legal
# Apprentice data starts as, throws it into a dataframe and then pickles that
# to the /Pickle directory.

# The assumption here is that the data stored at "~/.Data/" hasn't previously
# been pickled and the running of this function is to create the pickle file
# of the JSON-formatted NEW data, which is then moved to the /Pickle directory;
# thus, the "./Data/" directory only contains that data which needs to be
# pickled and nothing else and any data in the /Pickle directory has either
# been moved or renamed so as not to overwrite any previous work (that should
# not be overwritten).
