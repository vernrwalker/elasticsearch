2|3|1400029P34S1|1400029|False|FindingSentence|5. The Veteran's lay account of exposure to enemy mortar and gunfire attacks in Vietnam are credible and consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service to include his military occupational specialty (MOS), unit, and assignment and duties, without clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.
3|5|1400029P35S1|1400029|False|FindingSentence|6. The most probative evidence establishes that the Veteran does not have a current diagnosis of PTSD in accordance within the applicable VA regulation.
4|6|1400029P46S1|1400029|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
5|7|1400029P115S1|1400029|False|Sentence|Analysis - Service Connection for PTSD
6|9|1400029P116S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|In this case, the Veteran has contended that he has PTSD attributable to several combat and noncombat-related stressors in Vietnam.
7|11|1400029P116S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, he has asserted that he experienced enemy attacks with gunfire close to his base immediately upon arriving in Vietnam with subsequent, occasional mortar attacks on the base.
8|13|1400029P116S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|He has also claimed that, while he was riding in transportation convoys to deliver supplies, his unit sustained enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks on several occasions.
9|14|1400029P116S4|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|(It is noted however that the Veteran contradicted this story at the September 2011 VA examination when reporting that he was not shot at while travelling in a convoy).
10|16|1400029P116S5|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|"He has further maintained that one of his ""close friends"" was killed by military security while entering the gates of his base in an apparent accident, but he has noted that he did not witness the event."
11|18|1400029P116S6|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|He has not provided the name of the deceased soldier.
12|20|1400029P116S7|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the Veteran has alleged that he had PTSD-related symptoms since service, especially anxiety.
13|21|1400029P116S8|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See July 2013 hearing testimony at pages 23-32; VA psychological examinations dated in December 1991, November 2010, and September 2011; September 2010 stressor statements.
14|23|1400029P117S1|1400029|False|FindingSentence|Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for PTSD.
15|26|1400029P118S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Initially, the Veteran's service personnel records and Report of Separation from the Armed Forces (DD Form 214) do not reflect receipt of medals, badges, or decorations that specifically denote combat with the enemy.
16|30|1400029P118S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|His service personnel records and DD Form 214 do document that he received medals and awards, such as the Vietnam Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the National Defense Service Medal among others, but there is no award that establishes that he engaged in combat.
17|32|1400029P118S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, his military occupational specialty (MOS) was an armorer/unit supplier, which is not indicative of combat.
18|34|1400029P118S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|He has also never stated that he actually engaged in combat with the enemy.
19|36|1400029P118S5|1400029|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the combat provisions are not for application.
20|37|1400029P118S6|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(2).
21|38|1400029P118S7|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See also 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(b) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(d) (pertaining to combat Veterans).
22|39|1400029P119S1|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|"Nevertheless, under the July 13, 2010, liberalizing amendments to the PTSD regulation, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of claimed in-service stressors that are the result of ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" in certain instances."
23|40|1400029P119S2|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).
24|42|1400029P119S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|"In this regard, the September 2011 VA psychological examiner indicated that the Veteran's alleged stressors of enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks while travelling in supply convoys and while assigned to his base are related to the ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity."""
25|43|1400029P119S4|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|In addition, the Board finds that the Veteran's descriptions of the claimed enemy attack stressors are consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service in the U.S. Army in Vietnam at that time.
26|44|1400029P119S5|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 1154(a); 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
27|47|1400029P119S6|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's DD Form 214 and service personnel records confirm that he served in Vietnam from September 1970 to May 1971 with the 597th Transportation Company in the U.S. Army.
28|49|1400029P119S7|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|His MOS as an armorer/unit supplier is also supportive of his assertions that he travelled in supply convoys in Vietnam on occasion, with the possibility of being subject to enemy attack on occasion.
29|50|1400029P119S8|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no clear and convincing evidence to the contrary that he was not involved in these incidents.
30|52|1400029P119S9|1400029|False|FindingSentence|Thus, under the amended PTSD regulation, the Veteran's lay testimony and statements alone establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressors of enemy mortar, artillery, and gunfire attacks while travelling in supply convoys and while assigned to his base.
31|53|1400029P119S10|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).
32|55|1400029P120S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's service treatment records do not reveal complaints, treatment, or diagnosis of PTSD or any other acquired psychiatric disorder.
33|56|1400029P120S2|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, as to PTSD, an in-service diagnosis is not required.
34|57|1400029P120S3|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
35|59|1400029P120S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Post-service, the Veteran did report symptoms of nervousness and anxiety in August 1971, which was several months after his discharge from service.
36|62|1400029P120S5|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|However, VA psychological testing was normal at that time and did not reveal any mental health disorder.
37|63|1400029P121S1|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|With respect to the criteria of a current diagnosis of PTSD, the threshold consideration for any service connection claim is the existence of a current disability.
38|64|1400029P121S2|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 1110; 38 C.F.R. § 3.303; Boyer v. West, 210 F.3d 1351, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Brammer v. Derwinski, 3 Vet. App. 223, 225 (1992).
39|65|1400029P121S3|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|In particular, aside from verification of an in-service stressor, current medical evidence diagnosing PTSD in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV) is required, as well as competent evidence of a nexus between current PTSD symptomatology and his verified in-service stressor.
40|66|1400029P121S4|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f). See also Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).
41|67|1400029P121S5|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|Under the amended PTSD regulation, effective July 13, 2010, a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, must confirm that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that a Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in order to warrant service connection for PTSD.
42|68|1400029P121S6|1400029|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3) (2013).
43|69|1400029P122S1|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|With regard to a diagnosis of PTSD based on his in-service stressors from Vietnam, the record reflects several favorable and unfavorable medical opinions of record.
44|72|1400029P122S2|1400029|False|FindingSentence|However, upon review, in the present case, the Board finds the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).
45|73|1400029P123S1|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board must determine, as a question of fact, both the weight and credibility of the evidence.
46|74|1400029P123S2|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|Equal weight is not accorded to each piece of evidence contained in a record; every item does not have the same probative value.
47|75|1400029P123S3|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board must account for the evidence which it finds to be persuasive or unpersuasive, analyze the credibility and probative value of all material evidence submitted by and on behalf of a claimant, and provide the reasons for its rejection of any such evidence.
48|76|1400029P123S4|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See Struck v. Brown, 9 Vet. App. 145, 152 (1996); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995); Gabrielson v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 36, 40 (1994); Abernathy v. Principi, 3 Vet. App. 461, 465 (1992); Simon v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 621, 622 (1992); Hatlestad v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 164, 169 (1991).
49|77|1400029P124S1|1400029|False|Sentence|In evaluating the probative value of competent medical evidence, the Court has stated, in pertinent part:
50|78|1400029P125S1|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's personal examination of the patient, the physician's knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and the medical conclusion that the physician reaches.
51|79|1400029P125S2|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|. . . As is true with any piece of evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to these opinions [are] within the province of the adjudicators; . . .
52|80|1400029P126S1|1400029|False|CitationSentence|Guerrieri v. Brown, 4 Vet. App. 467, 470-71 (1993).
53|81|1400029P126S2|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|It is not error for the Board to favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over that of another when the Board gives an adequate statement of reasons or bases.
54|82|1400029P126S3|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See Owens v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 429, 433 (1995).
55|84|1400029P127S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|With regard to the positive evidence, in 2010 and 2011, a private psychologist, Dr. A.G., PhD., diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD due to his Vietnam experiences.
56|86|1400029P127S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Dr. A.G. believed the Veteran met the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.
57|88|1400029P127S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|She added that his particular post-service line of work as a firefighter makes it more likely for him to experience PTSD symptoms or exacerbation of earlier trauma.
58|90|1400029P127S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|She noted symptoms, such as hypervigilance, reduced sleeping, nightmares, and anxiety.
59|92|1400029P127S5|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|She indicated that the Veteran was no longer able to work as a firefighter due to his PTSD symptoms.
60|93|1400029P127S6|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|The conclusion of Dr. A.G. provides some evidence in support of the PTSD claim.
61|95|1400029P128S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|On the other hand, a December 1991 VA psychological examiner diagnosed with Veteran with generalized anxiety disorder, but would not confirm a diagnosis for PTSD.
62|97|1400029P128S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in rendering this opinion, the VA examiner did not have access to the Veteran's claims folder or any of the treatment records immediately after discharge reflecting the Veteran's complaints of nervousness.
63|98|1400029P128S3|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, this VA opinion is entitled to limited probative value.
64|100|1400029P129S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2010 VA psychological examiner also provided a very detailed discussion of the Veteran's history of psychiatric treatment since discharge from service in 1971.
65|103|1400029P129S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner discussed the Veteran's in-service stressors thoroughly; however, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD or any other mental disorder.
66|105|1400029P129S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA examiner indicated that the overall level of stress exposure based on frequency and severity of incident exposure was ""low."""
67|107|1400029P129S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner added that the Veteran was ""vague"" as to whether he was horrified at the time of the stressors."
68|109|1400029P129S5|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, the examiner remarked that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD of reporting symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal.
69|110|1400029P129S6|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|This examination provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.
70|113|1400029P130S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, a November 2010 VA mental health assessment from a nurse practitioner indicated that a diagnosis of PTSD had to be ruled out, but added that, based on his reported symptoms, he had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia and did not meet the criteria for PTSD at that time.
71|115|1400029P130S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran warranted further evaluation in the future due to his traumatic stressors as a firefighter and in Vietnam.
72|117|1400029P130S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|None of the other VA mental health records dated in 2010 diagnosed PTSD.
73|119|1400029P130S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|"In fact, at a December 2010 VA mental health assessment, the Veteran ""was unable to identify a specific stressor that may account for his 'nervousness' following time in Vietnam."""
74|121|1400029P131S1|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a September 2011 VA psychological examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under the DSM-IV or any other mental disorder.
75|123|1400029P131S2|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|After discussing the Veteran's stressors, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's stressors were not sufficiently traumatic and were not adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD for this particular Veteran.
76|125|1400029P131S3|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran also answered in the negative regarding every single criterion for PTSD when specifically queried by the examiner about each and every symptom.
77|127|1400029P131S4|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|The examination revealed that he did not meet the DSM-IV criterion A through E for PTSD.
78|129|1400029P131S5|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|In particular, the Veteran did not persistently reexperience his traumatic events from Vietnam; there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness; there were no persistent symptoms of increased arousal; and the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD.
79|131|1400029P131S6|1400029|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also did not endorse a single symptom of clinical depression.
80|132|1400029P131S7|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|This examination also provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.
81|135|1400029P131S8|1400029|False|FindingSentence|Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).
82|136|1400029P131S9|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, the November 2010 and September 2011 VA psychological examinations in particular were thorough, supported by an explanation, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.
83|137|1400029P131S10|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|The VA opinions and treatment records outweigh the private treatment of record on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV.
84|138|1400029P131S11|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|After an extensive interview and testing, the VA examiners provided greater detail in assessing whether the Veteran met each of the DSM-IV criteria (A through E) for PTSD than the private psychologist, Dr. A.G.
85|139|1400029P132S1|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|With regard to lay evidence, the Board notes that lay persons are not categorically incompetent to speak on matters of medical diagnosis or etiology.
86|140|1400029P132S2|1400029|False|CitationSentence|Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009).
87|141|1400029P132S3|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board must consider the type of condition specifically claimed and whether it is readily amenable to lay diagnosis or probative comment on etiology.
88|142|1400029P132S4|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456, 462 (2007).
89|143|1400029P132S5|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|In this vein, the Board acknowledges the Veteran is competent to report psychiatric symptoms both during and after service.
90|144|1400029P132S6|1400029|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(2); Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1377 (discussing that Veteran is competent to report a contemporaneous medical diagnosis); Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (discussing general competency of a Veteran to report psychiatric symptoms).
91|145|1400029P132S7|1400029|False|ReasoningSentence|That notwithstanding, in the instant case, the Board has found the Veteran's lay statements are less persuasive than the post-service medical evidence finding that the Veteran does not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.
92|146|1400029P132S8|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.
93|147|1400029P132S9|1400029|False|CitationSentence|King v. Shinseki, 700 F.3d 1339, 1344 (2012).
94|148|1400029P132S10|1400029|False|LegalRuleSentence|Moreover, although the Veteran is competent to describe his psychiatric symptoms, by regulation, PTSD is a condition that can only be diagnosed by a medical professional, according to 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
95|151|1400029P133S1|1400029|False|FindingSentence|Although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the preponderance of the evidence is service connection for PTSD.

288|457|1607479P81S2|1607479|False|ReasoningSentence|Her statement alone is insufficient to establish a diagnosis of PTSD and as a lay person, she lacks the expertise to say that any current psychiatric disability is the result of an event in service.

339|528|1514004P43S4|1514004|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when entering service as to a psychiatric disorder.
340|529|1514004P44S1|1514004|False|ReasoningSentence|Service records tend to show that at least psychiatric symptoms manifested during service.
341|531|1514004P44S2|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|Following his deployment to Vietnam in September 1968, he was accompanied by a recommendation for limited duty and deployment only to a location where psychiatric outpatient treatment was available.
342|533|1514004P44S3|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|In November 1968, he was noted to be more reclusive, more depressed, and getting worse.
343|535|1514004P45S1|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|After service, a December 1992 VA examination report reflecting a history of having come under small arms fire in a helicopter during service in Vietnam notes that the Veteran was transferred by helicopter on a weekly basis to psychiatric appointments.
344|538|1514004P45S2|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, on the accompanying medical history the Veteran indicated that he had depression or excessive worry, memory loss, and nervous trouble.
345|539|1514004P46S1|1514004|False|ReasoningSentence|With respect to diagnosis, and although a November 2011 VA examination report reflects a diagnosis of somatoform disorder, a November 2010 VA examination report noting a history of the Veteran's camp having regularly come under mortar attack during service in Vietnam reflects the Veteran meets the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.  
346|540|1514004P47S1|1514004|False|ReasoningSentence|Consistent with the November 2010 VA examiner's opinion is the opinion of the July 2011 private physician who determined that the Veteran meets the criteria for not only a diagnosis of PTSD but also generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
347|543|1514004P47S2|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence| Both the July 2011 private report and the December 1992 VA examination report conclude that the most traumatic circumstance of the Veteran's Vietnam service was related to the Veteran not being permitted to carry a gun due to his psychiatric disorder.
348|545|1514004P48S1|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|The private report states that the Veteran felt terrified and feared for his life the entire time he was serving in Vietnam.
349|547|1514004P48S2|1514004|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician noted that PTSD is most severe in individuals such as the Veteran who have an underlying psychiatric disorder such as GAD.
350|551|1514004P48S3|1514004|False|FindingSentence|Based on this new July 2011 private treatment report, in conjunction with the other evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder related to service.
351|553|1514004P49S1|1514004|False|FindingSentence|Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence is in favor of the claim.
352|554|1514004P49S2|1514004|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. § 3.102.
353|555|1514004P49S3|1514004|False|Sentence|Consequently, service connection for PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder is warranted.

The Veteran's diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.

364|572|1514581P34S2|1514581|False|Sentence|The Veteran has a fairly complex psychiatric history.
365|573|1514581P35S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.

376|585|1514581P37S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that she was exposed to stressful events during the course of her duties as a photographer in the United States Air Force and that she has PTSD as a result.
377|588|1514581P37S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also asserted that she was placed on medical hold shortly after she entered service and testified that not knowing whether she would be able to continue her military service caused her a great deal of stress.
378|589|1514581P38S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|To establish service connection for PTSD, specifically, the evidence must satisfy three basic elements.
379|590|1514581P38S2|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|There must be 1) medical evidence diagnosing PTSD; 2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms of PTSD and an in-service stressor; and 3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
380|591|1514581P38S3|1514581|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
381|592|1514581P38S4|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|The diagnosis of PTSD must comply with the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM- IV).
382|593|1514581P38S5|1514581|False|CitationSentence|Id., see also 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a).
383|595|1514581P39S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|It is undisputed that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of this appeal, in satisfaction of the first element of service connection.
384|596|1514581P39S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Yet, it is the relationship between service and the current disability, if any, that is at issue here, and it is the delayed onset, typical with PTSD, that complicates the relevant analysis for decision-makers and health care providers alike.
385|597|1514581P40S1|1514581|False|Sentence|So, the Board next turns to the occurrence of military stressors.
386|598|1514581P40S2|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|The credible supporting evidence required to establish an in-service stressor depends upon the nature of the stressor.
387|599|1514581P40S3|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Special provisions allow that the occurrence of a claimed in-service stressor can be shown by certain kinds of credible supporting evidence where the claimed stressor involved personal assault, fear of enemy or terrorist activity, combat, service as a prisoner of war (POW), or diagnosis of PTSD during service.
388|600|1514581P40S4|1514581|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
389|601|1514581P40S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|None of the stressors reported by the Veteran fit into these categories.
390|602|1514581P40S6|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|In cases such as this, credible supporting evidence of the occurrence of the stressor must be provided by someone other than the Veteran and cannot be provided solely by after the fact medical nexus evidence.
391|603|1514581P40S7|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See generally Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997).
392|604|1514581P41S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Within the legal framework for evaluating claims of service connection for PTSD, the sufficiency of a stressor is a medical determination, while the occurrence of the stressor is a legal determination.
393|605|1514581P41S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|Sizemore v. Principi, 18 Vet. App. 264 (2004).
394|607|1514581P41S3|1514581|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events is credibly supported in the record, as her DD-214 documents a military occupational specialty of still photographic specialist.
395|608|1514581P41S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, she provided a statement from a fellow service photographer, who corroborated that she was responsible for documenting plane crashes, child abuse incidents, and spousal abuse incidents, as well as an occasion when a flight-line Airman was killed when a landing gear tire exploded.
396|610|1514581P41S5|1514581|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board finds that the stressors, as described, are consistent with the circumstances of the Veteran's military service.
397|611|1514581P41S6|1514581|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.303(a).
398|613|1514581P41S7|1514581|False|FindingSentence|The third element specific to service connection for PTSD is met.
399|616|1514581P42S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board pauses to note that service treatment records show that the Veteran did have a pre-existing ear disorder at the time of service enlistment and that she was placed on medical hold pending a determination as to whether she was fit for worldwide duty assignment.
400|618|1514581P42S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Though explicitly noting these facts, in the context of the Veteran's contentions, the VA examiner did not identify the event as a stressor that was sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
401|619|1514581P43S1|1514581|False|Sentence|The Board now turns to the evidence pertaining to a link between the current disability and the Veteran's conceded military stressors.
402|620|1514581P43S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As a starting point, the Board recognizes that prior decisions have found that the weight of evidence links the present PTSD, diagnosed after service, with the Veteran's childhood traumas prior to service.
403|621|1514581P44S1|1514581|False|Sentence|A.
404|622|1514581P45S1|1514581|False|Sentence|Consequently, the Veteran's representative has invoked the presumption of soundness.
405|623|1514581P45S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1111, 1132.
406|624|1514581P45S3|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|A veteran is presumed to be in sound condition upon entrance into service, except for defects, infirmities, or disorders noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, or where evidence or medical judgment is such as to warrant a finding that the disease or injury existed before acceptance and enrollment.
407|625|1514581P45S4|1514581|False|CitationSentence|Id.
408|626|1514581P45S5|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Only such conditions as are recorded in examination reports are to be considered as noted.
409|627|1514581P45S6|1514581|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).
410|628|1514581P46S1|1514581|False|Sentence|The Board first must determine whether the presumption of soundness applies.
411|630|1514581P46S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the Veteran was found to be psychiatrically normal at a November 1984 medical examination prior to her entrance into service.
412|631|1514581P46S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, notation of a pre-existing disability is not a bar to the application of the presumption of soundness, in this case.
413|632|1514581P46S4|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Ordinarily, where such defects, infirmities, or disorders are not noted when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, VA must show by clear and unmistakable evidence both that the disease or injury existed prior to service and that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service, in order to rebut the presumption of soundness on entry into service.
414|633|1514581P46S5|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004); VAOPGCPREC 3-03.
415|634|1514581P47S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, as a threshold showing before the presumption of soundness may be applied, with its burden shifting provisions, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service actually manifested or was incurred in service.
416|635|1514581P47S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012).
417|636|1514581P47S3|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Court has cautioned that the presumption of soundness is not a sword for a veteran to fulfill the second element of service connection without any evidence of the manifestation of an in-service disability.
418|637|1514581P47S4|1514581|False|CitationSentence|"Id.; Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2012) (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service."")."
419|639|1514581P48S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD manifested during service.
420|641|1514581P48S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|"The relevant evidence on this question includes a February 2007 VA examination report where the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran suffered PTSD in her youth and that this was ""possibly aggravated"" by service."
421|642|1514581P48S3|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|"The statement regarding aggravation, without identification of the factual predicate for the conclusion, does not establish manifestation of the disability in service, nor does mere possibility rise to the requisite ""at least as likely as not"" threshold."
422|643|1514581P48S4|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993).
423|645|1514581P48S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Of note, the examiner gave no explanation as to how aggravation was felt to have occurred, as no baseline level of severity of psychiatric impairment was identified.
424|646|1514581P49S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Owing to the unique character of mental health illness, and attendant complexity of neurological and psychological pathology, the Court has acknowledged delayed-onset PTSD.
425|647|1514581P49S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|"See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""'Because of the complexity of PTSD. . .PTSD can occur hours, months, or years after a military stressor.'"")."
426|648|1514581P49S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|A retrospective review of the record may well allow a mental healthcare provider to conclude that earlier events caused or aggravated subsequently diagnosed PTSD.
427|649|1514581P49S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Even so, that is not the case here.
428|650|1514581P49S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, such a conclusion need not necessarily be based on contemporaneous symptoms but, instead, on clinical expertise, informed by developments over a veteran's lifetime.
429|651|1514581P49S6|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Consequently, as the possible aggravation was not associated with contemporaneous manifestation, the Board affords this statement little, if any, weight in its final resolution of the instant matter.
430|654|1514581P50S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|In fact, VA examiners, in applying clinical judgment to the record, have consistently declined to draw the conclusion and the Veteran has not shown-to the at least as likely as not standard-that her PTSD manifested in service.
431|655|1514581P50S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As a VA examiner in June 2013 explained, after a comprehensive review of the record and recitation of pertinent facts, the service treatment records repeatedly rule out diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.
432|657|1514581P50S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|As detailed in the Board's now vacated decisions, the record shows that the Veteran was evaluated during service by psychiatric services.
433|659|1514581P50S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985.
434|662|1514581P50S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Mental status examination at that time was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.
435|664|1514581P50S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that her records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems.
436|666|1514581P50S7|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.
437|669|1514581P50S8|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was also seen by psychiatric services in June 1990, shortly before separation, with the notation of no diagnosis in the record.
438|671|1514581P50S9|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Likewise, the Veteran was found psychiatrically normal in the Report of Medical Examination at separation in July 1990.
439|673|1514581P51S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, there is no evidence of symptoms attributed at the time, or in retrospect by a health care provider, to PTSD.
440|675|1514581P51S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints or abnormalities related to any psychiatric problems during service.
441|677|1514581P51S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding the June 1990 entry, the service records show that the Veteran was seen by psychiatric services for stress and for evaluation of extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.
442|679|1514581P51S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|No specific findings were reported and, again, the diagnosis on Axis I was no diagnosis.
443|682|1514581P51S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|At the April 2011 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran submitted a letter from a fellow soldier who recalled a time when the Veteran was sad and distant.
444|684|1514581P51S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Yet, on a July 1990 Report of Medical History at separation from service, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort.
445|686|1514581P52S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also acknowledged in her February 2007 VA examination and April 2011 Travel Board hearing that she did not have any psychiatric problems during service and she denied seeking any psychiatric treatment, including at the time of discharge from service.
446|688|1514581P52S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had PTSD or symptoms attributable to PTSD, during service.
447|690|1514581P53S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|As an alternative to diagnosis or obvious symptoms of PTSD in service, the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and behavioral problems in service, purportedly indicative of PTSD.
448|691|1514581P53S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board recognizes that not every deficiency or failure to succeed is the hallmark of mental health illness.
449|692|1514581P53S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that a clinical diagnosis is warranted, such a determination is, again, soundly within the purview of a mental healthcare provider.
450|694|1514581P54S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).
451|696|1514581P54S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.
452|699|1514581P54S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.
453|701|1514581P55S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.
454|702|1514581P55S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.
455|704|1514581P55S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She was counseled numerous times on the condition both of her dormitory room and of her uniform and on her personal hygiene, with little or no improvement.
456|706|1514581P55S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She had angry outbursts at work and in the dormitory which alienated the Veteran from her peers, and despite financial counseling regarding several overdue accounts at various local businesses, she continued to spend to excess.
457|708|1514581P55S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to sergeant in October 1989 but was subsequently recommended and promoted to E-5 in February 1990.
458|710|1514581P55S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in July 1990, the Veteran's commanding officer recommended that the Veteran's appointment (promotion) be vacated.
459|714|1514581P56S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have in the past six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but that she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military career.
460|716|1514581P57S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The service records showed that the Veteran was AWOL on the day she was seen at the mental health clinic in June 1990 and that she subsequently received nonjudicial punishment (Article 15) for her actions, which included punching a hole in a wall.
461|718|1514581P57S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.
462|719|1514581P58S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that the Veteran has now alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems-however manifest-during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of PTSD.
463|720|1514581P58S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|"See Young, 766 F.3d at 1353 (""PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence, standing alone, is competent and sufficient to identify."
464|721|1514581P58S3|1514581|False|Sentence|"'Because of the complexity of PTSD, the application of careful clinical judgment is necessary to identify and describe the relationship between past events and current symptoms.'"")."
465|723|1514581P59S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In June 2013, the VA examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service.
466|725|1514581P59S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Critically, she indicated that the pattern was a result of her diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her later diagnosis of PTSD.
467|728|1514581P59S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any mention of symptoms of anxiety as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.
468|730|1514581P59S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties occurred as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.
469|731|1514581P59S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds this compelling opinion and rationale most probative of the issue regarding the absence of manifest PTSD in service.
470|732|1514581P60S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|As was explained, absent a finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
471|733|1514581P60S2|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 54.
472|734|1514581P60S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability had onset or was present during service.
473|735|1514581P60S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.
474|736|1514581P60S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.
475|739|1514581P61S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|As such, even though the Veteran has, since service, identified in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of PTSD.
476|740|1514581P61S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Simple concession of a military stressor does not constitute manifestation of disease, as that is only one of many criteria that must combine into a diagnosis of PTSD.
477|742|1514581P61S3|1514581|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application in this case.
478|743|1514581P62S1|1514581|False|Sentence|B.
479|744|1514581P63S1|1514581|False|Sentence|The analysis does not stop there, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD-though not manifest during-was nonetheless either caused or aggravated by her military service.
480|746|1514581P63S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|As noted above, the occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are credibly supported in the record.
481|748|1514581P63S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support criterion A of a PTSD diagnosis.
482|749|1514581P64S1|1514581|False|Sentence|However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's later-diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.
483|750|1514581P64S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD, as previously detailed.
484|751|1514581P64S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service, the medical evidence of record does not actually show that associated PTSD was ever diagnosed, despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.
485|752|1514581P65S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also appreciates that the Veteran did not seek mental health treatment and was not diagnosed with PTSD for more than a decade after service.
486|753|1514581P65S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|These post-service treatment records weigh against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events.
487|755|1514581P65S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran reported first initiating contact with a mental health professional in June 2002, at which time she related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle."""
488|757|1514581P65S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She also detailed abuse suffered as a child.
489|759|1514581P66S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She did not follow-up with treatment until May 2005 when she was hospitalized at the Tucson VA due to depression.
490|761|1514581P66S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, and the focus of treatment was exclusively on the Veteran's former spouse, from which she was estranged over the preceding three years, and on her traumatic childhood.
491|763|1514581P66S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|A VA psychiatric note the second day of admission showed that the Veteran had several other stressors, including financial concerns.
492|765|1514581P66S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Other than reporting her period of military service, the Veteran made no mention of any problems related to service.
493|767|1514581P67S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran presented with impaired sleep and concentration, depression, nightmares, and anger.
494|769|1514581P67S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Nightmares involved children being beaten and her father harming her sister.
495|771|1514581P67S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She also reported recurrent intrusive thoughts about the death of her fiancée in a 1997 automobile accident, which she witnessed.
496|773|1514581P67S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She mentioned taking photos of women and children who were beaten or raped (including an image of 4-year-old boy in particular).
497|775|1514581P67S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|This treatment encounter resulted is the first diagnosis of PTSD in the record; no specific etiology was noted.
498|777|1514581P68S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was seen at a private medical facility in December 2006.
499|779|1514581P68S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|There, she reported that her emotional problems dated back to her childhood and were related to her physically abusive father.
500|781|1514581P68S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She again reported the events involving her sister, endorsing bouts of depression and nightmares ever since the incident.
501|783|1514581P68S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, delayed-onset, and MDD, without psychosis.
502|785|1514581P69S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Social Security Administration records contain a Functional Capacity Evaluation (mental) dated February 2007, which showed a diagnosis of PTSD secondary to childhood and military trauma and of co-morbid dysthymic disorder.
503|787|1514581P69S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The assessment does not identify the nature of the military stressor and provides no rationale or analysis of the PTSD criteria.
504|788|1514581P69S3|1514581|False|CitationSentence|"See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (explaining that ""most of the probative value of a medical opinion comes from its reasoning."")."
505|789|1514581P69S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board affords little probative value to this conclusory piece of evidence, in light of the record as a whole.
506|791|1514581P70S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in February 2007, to assist in determining the nature and etiology of her psychiatric disorders.
507|793|1514581P70S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner reviewed the claims file and performed a mental status examination.
508|795|1514581P70S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported that she had one psychiatric session when she was about ten years old because of temper tantrums and said that she was abused physically, mentally, and emotionally as a child, but was uncertain regarding sexual abuse.
509|797|1514581P70S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran denied any psychiatric treatment in service.
510|799|1514581P70S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She described a number of incidents in service when she photographed gruesome scenes, the most troubling of which involved a child who had been physically abused.
511|801|1514581P70S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She said that this reminded her of when she was abused as a child.
512|803|1514581P71S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|On mental status examination, the examiner noted that the Veteran showed a full range of affect and there were no signs of any mood disorder or sadness.
513|805|1514581P71S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She had excellent eye contact, articulated her speech in a goal directed manner and was fully animated, coming to the exam with her notes organized.
514|807|1514581P71S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran's speech was dramatic and at times, embellished in detail, and that she was quick to endorse items, apparently trying to make herself look more disturbed than she was.
515|809|1514581P71S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was alert and well-oriented with no indication of any short- or long-term memory or cognitive impairment.
516|811|1514581P71S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|He noted that the Veteran's memory seemed somewhat selective and that while she had a vague memory of some of the incidents from her youth, it could also be a pattern of her communication or possibly due to amnesic episodes to dissociative disorder; all of which could be consistent with PTSD.
517|813|1514581P71S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner ultimately diagnosed PTSD, at least as likely as not from childhood abuse.
518|815|1514581P72S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, she continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which predominantly related to her childhood abuse.
519|817|1514581P72S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|When seen by VA for individual counseling in July 2007, the Veteran reported that when she heard a child crying, it reminded her of when she was a photographer in the service and had to take a picture of an abused child for court documentation.
520|819|1514581P72S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran said the she was physically, sexually, and verbally abused as a child and felt this was part of her PTSD.
521|821|1514581P72S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She also said that she would like to continue doing photography but did not have the finances.
522|823|1514581P72S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran thought that she had PTSD because she is constantly worried about life in general, was irritable and angry, and has flashbacks from her childhood, nightmares, and difficulty sleeping.
523|825|1514581P72S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In his assessment, the psychiatrist commented that the Veteran had vague symptoms of PTSD.
524|827|1514581P72S7|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|He noted that while the Veteran reported recurrent thoughts of her childhood and associated nightmares, she never mentioned any avoidant behavior, isolation, re-experiencing, or feelings of detachment, generally associated with PTSD.
525|830|1514581P72S8|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Ultimately, though documenting the Veteran's express opinion regarding a positive link between PTSD and service, the provider, after clinical assessment, concluded any such diagnosis would be associated with childhood trauma.
526|832|1514581P73S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|When seen in September 2007, the Veteran reported that she was under a lot of stress but felt that she was doing better, and she believed that her depression and anxiety would improve once she began the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) process.
527|834|1514581P73S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In November 2007, she said that she had vivid flashbacks of personal childhood abuse over and over daily.
528|836|1514581P74S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|When seen in August 2008, the Veteran reported improvement since moving out of a shelter and into her own residence.
529|838|1514581P74S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In January and February 2009, the Veteran reported that she was sleeping better and that her nightmares had decreased to one- to-two per week with her medication.
530|840|1514581P74S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|"When seen in January 2010, the Veteran reported feeling ""pretty good"" and that her nightmares were minimal."
531|842|1514581P74S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The assessment at that time was gender identity disorder, with questionable history of sub-syndromal PTSD.
532|844|1514581P74S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|When seen in April 2010, the VA psychiatrist noted that the Veteran took Prazosin on occasion for her nightmares, the context of which were relatively vague.
533|848|1514581P74S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The psychiatrist indicated that she was unable to definitely establish a diagnosis of PTSD, though she noted that the Veteran did report symptoms of irritability and nightmares related to early childhood events.
534|851|1514581P75S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|When seen by VA in September 2010, the Veteran reported disturbing nightmares, but said that her depressive symptoms had improved significantly since getting in contact with her sister.
535|853|1514581P75S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported nightmares every other night involving a motor vehicle accident and of a friend being decapitated.
536|855|1514581P75S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She talked about her service days, including the time that she took a picture of an airman who had been decapitated.
537|857|1514581P75S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner indicated that the Veteran had a history of questionable sub-syndromal PTSD.
538|859|1514581P75S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The diagnosis was mood disorder, NOS.
539|861|1514581P76S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, a VA medical opinion was obtained in June 2013.
540|863|1514581P76S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.
541|865|1514581P76S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|However, she found that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular PTSD.
542|866|1514581P77S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|This assessment is relatively consistent with the VA treatment records detailed above.
543|870|1514581P77S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.
544|872|1514581P77S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.
545|874|1514581P77S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancée died.
546|876|1514581P77S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In recent treatment, she cited this as the most traumatic event she had experienced.
547|878|1514581P77S6|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.
548|879|1514581P78S1|1514581|False|Sentence|In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.
549|880|1514581P78S2|1514581|False|Sentence|"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors."
550|881|1514581P78S3|1514581|False|Sentence|The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors.
551|882|1514581P78S4|1514581|False|Sentence|Yet, the representative suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have resurfaced the Veteran's childhood traumas-even now hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.
552|883|1514581P79S1|1514581|False|Sentence|The Board has considered this argument and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.
553|886|1514581P79S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the examiner found that the witnessing of traumatic events, such as the ones photographed by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criterion A, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case, the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criterion B (symptoms of reexperiencing) or C and D (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences.
554|888|1514581P79S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and her fiancée's death in 1997-not with the Veteran's experiences in service.
555|889|1514581P79S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|"Moreover, although the representative had suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors."
556|890|1514581P79S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.
557|891|1514581P80S1|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|While the Veteran is competent to provide evidence concerning her observations and experiences, any such assertions must be weighed against other evidence of record, including her inconsistent and contradictory statements.

564|898|1514581P81S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other lay and medical evidence of record.
565|899|1514581P81S3|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias or inconsistent statements; and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony are also factors that may be considered.

569|903|1514581P82S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent, and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.
570|905|1514581P82S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.
571|906|1514581P82S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Yet, in a conflicting statement, she also stated that she did not seek treatment in service because she would have lost her security clearance.
572|908|1514581P83S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She again endorsed first realizing that there was something wrong in approximately 2002.
573|910|1514581P83S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|After doing some research, she realized that she had all the symptoms described for PTSD, including hypervigilance and panic attacks.
574|911|1514581P83S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.
575|913|1514581P83S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the March 2012 JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.
576|916|1514581P84S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares, and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service four-to-five times per week, she did not describe any such symptoms related to service when examined by VA in 2007.
577|918|1514581P84S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks."
578|921|1514581P84S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered and witnessed as a child and the death of her fiancée.
579|924|1514581P85S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005, as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until one and a half years later (see November 2006 treatment note), coincident with her September 2006 claim for same.
580|927|1514581P85S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Even during July 2007 treatment, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service and said only that when she heard a child cry, it reminded her of the child she photographed in service, who had been abused.
581|928|1514581P85S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|She consistently reported being physically and emotionally abused as a child and believed that this was part of her PTSD.
582|929|1514581P85S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed to be related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some four years later, and 18 months after documented psychiatric treatment-instead detailing prior and subsequent unrelated stressors-strains credibility.
583|930|1514581P85S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Even looking at the Veteran's efforts at VA examinations, it was noted at the February 2007 VA examination that the Veteran was quick to endorse items, apparently trying to make herself look more disturbed than she was, thereby suggesting a willingness to inaccurately discuss her medical symptomatology.
584|931|1514581P86S1|1514581|False|Sentence|The Board now turns to aggravation of PTSD by military stressors.
585|932|1514581P86S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As previously indicated, the February 2007 VA examination resulted in the possibility of aggravation-too equivocal to establish the requisite nexus.
586|933|1514581P86S3|1514581|False|Sentence|Nevertheless, because this examination had allowed for the possibility that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability had been aggravated by her military service, the Board, as directed by the July 2014 JMR, obtained a medical opinion to investigation the possibility of this association.
587|935|1514581P87S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In November 2014 the same examiner who completed the June 2013 examination addressed the question of whether the Veteran's military experiences aggravated his childhood based PTSD.
588|937|1514581P87S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|After fully reviewing the evidence of record, the examiner concluded that an opinion regarding aggravation of PTSD based on the impact of conceded traumas in service could not be rendered without resort to mere speculation.
589|939|1514581P87S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She explained that without documentation of any medical disorder or associated symptoms at any time prior to military service-symptoms which the Veteran herself denied appreciating even through her military service-there is no way to specify if traumatic memories of the military experiences were associated with a permanent worsening of the Veteran's PTSD.
590|941|1514581P87S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also noted that there was no baseline level of functioning found in the available medical evidence, upon which to base a conclusion that a condition had been aggravated.
591|942|1514581P88S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As explained by the examiner, the record does not provide a basis upon which to render a principled assessment regarding aggravation.
592|943|1514581P88S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|A medical opinion cannot be compelled where a health care provider has specifically identified the information necessary to render a clinical determination and has yet deemed the available information insufficient-or entirely absent.
593|944|1514581P88S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Neither the Veteran nor the record identifies or suggests any source of relevant evidence that might aid in a determination.
594|945|1514581P88S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board appreciates the complexity of such a determination on the sparsity of the available record and fully credits the VA examiner's explanation.
595|946|1514581P88S5|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 391 (2010) (stating a VA medical examination is not inadequate merely because the medical examiner states he or she cannot reach a conclusion without resort to speculation and the duty to assist does not extend to requiring a VA physician to render an opinion beyond what may reasonably be concluded from the procurable medical evidence).
596|947|1514581P88S6|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the examiner's conclusion is fully adequate and is not rendered inadequate solely on the grounds that the examiner stated that she could not form an opinion without resorting to speculation.
597|948|1514581P89S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.
598|949|1514581P89S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a highly probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancée.
599|950|1514581P89S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Additionally, while the Veteran was treated by several other psychiatrists over the years, most of those reports indicate that her current psychiatric problems were related to her childhood abuse.
600|953|1514581P90S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|The Board has considered whether the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's PTSD was aggravated by her in-service experiences, but finds that there is not sufficient evidence to meet the relative equipoise standard.
601|954|1514581P90S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, the absence of evidence to the contrary does not render it at least as likely as not that a psychiatric disability was aggravated, particularly when, as here, the is overwhelming evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disability is attributable to non-service related situations.
602|956|1514581P91S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|In conclusion, the preponderance of evidence establishes that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD years after service, based on pre- and post-service stressors, with no manifestation of PTSD during service.
603|957|1514581P91S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Consequently, the burden of proof, by any degree, has not been shifted to VA.
604|958|1514581P91S3|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, while the Veteran's duties as a photographer in service have been found to meet a single criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD, the remaining criteria have not been found by mental health professionals to be so met, in relation specifically to any military stressor.
605|960|1514581P91S4|1514581|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no supported and significantly probative evidence of diagnosed PTSD directly caused by the Veteran's active service.
606|961|1514581P91S5|1514581|False|Sentence|Last, pursuant to the July 2014 JMR, VA most recently sought an opinion as to whether military service yet aggravated the Veteran's PTSD, in light of suggested possibility.
607|962|1514581P91S6|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|While the burden of proof remains on the Veteran to at least balance the evidence for and against her claim, the VA examiner's reasoned opinion that the issue of aggravation cannot be resolved without resort to mere speculation provides no weight or counterweight at all, as the absence of evidence does not move the evidentiary scales.
608|964|1514581P91S7|1514581|False|FindingSentence|There is no credible and probative medical evidence to establish that military service aggravated PTSD diagnosed fifteen years later.
609|967|1514581P92S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|Based on the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD and her corroborated in-service stressor events.
610|970|1514581P92S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, and the claim must be denied.
611|971|1514581P93S1|1514581|False|Sentence|Other Acquired Psychiatric Disorders
612|973|1514581P94S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record demonstrates that, in addition to PTSD, the Veteran has also been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders during the pendency of this appeal, to include: major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
613|975|1514581P94S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|However, the totality of the competent medical evidence does not show that these conditions began during or were otherwise caused by the Veteran's military service.
614|977|1514581P95S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|As noted in the previous section, there is no indication that the Veteran had any psychiatric problems either in service or for more than a decade after service.
615|978|1514581P95S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|When first seeking treatment in June 2002, tellingly, the Veteran did not relate her depression to service but, instead, stated that it began when she left her wife to be involved in an alternative lifestyle.
616|980|1514581P95S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005, when she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily related to her ex-wife.
617|982|1514581P96S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Again, the Veteran filed a claim for VA disability benefits in September 2006.
618|984|1514581P96S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported the death of her fiancé in 1997 and mentioned in-service photos of disturbing images.
619|986|1514581P96S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, nightmares, and anger, which she was said began at age ten.
620|988|1514581P96S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|During private psychiatric assessment in December 2006, the Veteran reported that she had felt depressed since 1986, when she was placed on medical administrative hold pending evaluation of a pre-existing ear disorder.
621|990|1514581P96S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, with no comment regarding origin.
622|993|1514581P97S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|At the April 2011 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran submitted a letter from a fellow soldier who recalled a time when the Veteran was sad and distant.
623|995|1514581P97S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|However, as noted in the previous section, a psychiatric disorder was not noted at service entrance and service treatment records are negative for any diagnoses or treatment for major depressive disorder.
624|997|1514581P97S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In the Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.
625|998|1514581P97S4|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The board finds the contemporaneous record more probative than the statement twenty years later.
626|999|1514581P97S5|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (noting that contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than history as reported by a veteran).
627|1001|1514581P98S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|During January 2007 VA treatment, she reported struggling with her sexual identity since childhood, since seven or eight years old.
628|1002|1514581P99S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that VA treatment notes of record document an extensive and complex mental health history.
629|1004|1514581P99S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|However, they do not provide a medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's depression.
630|1006|1514581P99S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In efforts to obtain a medical opinion on the question of whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorders were etiologically related to service, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2007.
631|1008|1514581P99S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner, in pertinent part, diagnosed: gender identity disorder; depressive disorder, not otherwise specified (in full remission); and personality disorder with histrionic and narcissistic traits.
632|1010|1514581P100S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner opined that none of these psychiatric disorders were related to service.
633|1012|1514581P100S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In support of this opinion, the February 2007 VA examiner reasoned that there was no evidence during the examination that the Veteran was suffering from depression.
634|1014|1514581P100S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|According to the examiner, the suicidal note that the Veteran gave to a counselor in August of 2006 was for attention seeking behavior, as the Veteran had a pattern of behavior that would be inferred as narcissistic and/or histrionic.
635|1016|1514581P100S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that, since her youth, the Veteran seemed to have had a pattern of seeking attention suggesting a character or personality disorder.
636|1018|1514581P100S5|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner further noted that the Veteran also appeared to be troubled about gender issues.
637|1019|1514581P100S6|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the February 2007 VA medical opinion, which is uncontroverted in the record, highly probative of the nexus element for service connection of an acquired psychiatric disorder.
638|1021|1514581P101S1|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|In a subsequent June 2013 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran, in pertinent part, with personality disorder and gender identity disorder, which were found to be unrelated to events in service.
639|1023|1514581P101S2|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|Although it was noted that the Veteran continued to meet the criteria for a personality disorder diagnosis due to a pervasive pattern of interpersonal problems, inability to conform to some social norms, and limited adaptability to stressful environments, the personality disorder was found to be rooted in severe childhood abuse and not service.
640|1025|1514581P101S3|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|No other mental health illness was diagnosed (i.e. depressive disorder).
641|1027|1514581P101S4|1514581|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined that the psychiatric disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the service.
642|1028|1514581P101S5|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.
643|1029|1514581P102S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her psychiatric disorders to service.
644|1030|1514581P102S2|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|However, for the reasons discussed in detail in the previous section, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other evidence of record.
645|1031|1514581P103S1|1514581|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also finds that although the Veteran has repeatedly been diagnosed with a personality disorder, a personality disorder is not service connected, and is subject to important restrictions regarding service connection.
646|1032|1514581P103S2|1514581|False|LegalRuleSentence|Governing regulations provide that personality disorders are not diseases within the meaning of applicable legislation providing for payment of VA disability compensation benefits.
647|1033|1514581P103S3|1514581|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303(c), 4.9.
648|1036|1514581P104S1|1514581|False|FindingSentence|For these reasons, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence of record demonstrates that the Veteran's diagnosed psychiatric disorders, to include PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder, were not incurred in and are not otherwise etiologically related to service.
649|1038|1514581P104S2|1514581|False|FindingSentence|They have also not been shown to have been aggravated by the Veteran's military service.
650|1039|1514581P104S3|1514581|False|Sentence|Since the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

722|1122|1526599P50S7|1526599|False|FindingSentence|Because the entrance examination reflected only a history of nervous trouble, and the Veteran's psychiatric system was clinically evaluated as normal, the Board finds that a psychiatric disorder was not noted at entry into service.

735|1147|1526599P54S6|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|During July 2012 evaluation, the Veteran reported; (1) receiving fire and firing his weapon; (2) being shot down and trapped in a rice paddy with dead soldiers while under artillery fire; and (3) being shot down and trapped in a village while being separated from his unit.
736|1151|1526599P55S1|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|While the JSRRC found in January 2010 that the Veteran engaged in combat and experienced stressors while assigned to the 336th Assault Helicopter Squadron, in a subsequent May 2010 memorandum, the JSRRC determined that while the following claimed stressors occurred, there was no evidence that the Veteran witnessed them: (1) the Veteran's friend, D.P., sustaining a compound fracture of the back after being shot down on a mission; (2) L.M.S. being killed after being accidentally shot through the chest after disarming a mini gun; (3) G.L. being killed while at a re-fueling point, when he was struck in the head by a rotor; (4) shortly after returning home, learning of O.B. dying after receiving a head shot during a gun run; (5) J.W. being killed in a crash due to maintenance problems; (6) the Veteran's fire truck being separated from a convoy after they had traveled to a village outside of the compound to help put fires out; and (7) while on a convoy and driving through the village outside the Veteran's compound, the Vietnamese directing traffic got too close to the Veteran's truck and was run over by accident, and Viet Cong chopping off the heads of South Vietnamese soldiers they had killed.
737|1153|1526599P56S1|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran attended a VA PTSD examination in July 2012.

741|1161|1526599P56S5|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner concluded that the Veteran ""does not meet the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PTSD based on objective test results and diagnostic clinical interview from this examination."
742|1163|1526599P56S6|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|There is no objective evidence or data to support the diagnosis of PTSD at this time.

744|1166|1526599P56S8|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that additional VA outpatient treatment records dated in July 2012, August 2012 and November 2012, after the July 2012 VA opinion, are of record, those records are essentially cumulative of the VA records reviewed by the VA examiner as they are records of group counseling or show mental status evaluation by a PTSD nurse practitioner and do not include the use of objective measures regarding the diagnosis of PTSD.
745|1168|1526599P57S1|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|"During his December 2012 videoconference hearing, the Veteran testified that he experienced the stressors of: (1) while serving as a door gunner for the very first time, his gun jammed, and he had to switch and allow the other gunner to fire; (2) also while serving as a door gunner, the Veteran witnessed a helicopter pilot get killed while teaching the ""RNs"" how to fly, said pilot crashing into a building; and (3) the Veteran and another boy were separated from the patrol while in a tanker when they had to go to a village and help put out fires."
746|1171|1526599P58S1|1526599|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the weight of the evidence, lay and medical, does not demonstrate that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD.
747|1172|1526599P58S2|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|Viewing the evidence in its entirety, the Board finds that the July 2012 opinion has great evidentiary weight, because the rendered opinion reflects a review of the entire evidentiary record.
748|1174|1526599P58S3|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA clinical psychologist reviewed the claims folder and the Veteran's history, and provided a psychiatric diagnosis of depressive disorder, NOS.
749|1176|1526599P58S4|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner concluded that the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD.
750|1177|1526599P58S5|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|The VA examiner, as a psychologist, has the skill and expertise to render a diagnosis.

754|1181|1526599P59S1|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the July 2012 VA examination report and opinion outweighs the diagnoses of PTSD following evaluations by VA staff psychologists in April 2006 and March 2008, as well as by VA nurse practitioners in July 2012, August 2012, and November 2012.
755|1182|1526599P59S2|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|Specifically, the July 2012 examiner conducted a comprehensive review of the Veteran's psychiatric history as well as treatment records and evaluations, addressing evidence dated from 2000 to 2012, to include past diagnoses of PTSD.
756|1184|1526599P59S3|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted by the examiner, a Trauma Symptoms Inventory was completed as part of the evaluation.
757|1186|1526599P59S4|1526599|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also considered the evidence of record, including VA treatment records, in determining whether the Veteran had a current diagnosis of PTSD.

759|1188|1526599P60S1|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|Additionally, the Veteran is not competent to render a psychiatric diagnosis.

761|1190|1526599P60S3|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, such an opinion requires interpretation of symptoms, knowledge of the mental health field and consideration of the effects of other medical conditions, psychosocial and environmental problems and other levels of functioning.
762|1191|1526599P60S4|1526599|False|CitationSentence|See DSM-IV, pages 37-45 (4th ed. 1994) (describing the multiaxial assessment and explaining that it allows for considerations of mental disorders, general medical conditions, psychosocial and environmental problems that can all contribute to the mental disorder).
763|1192|1526599P60S5|1526599|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no evidence showing that the Veteran has medical expertise, and he is not competent to provide any medical or psychiatric diagnoses or medical opinions.

843|1310|1742191P51S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran underwent a VA examination in conjunction with his claim in January 2016.
844|1312|1742191P51S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD that conformed to the DSM-5 criteria, but that Persistent Depressive Disorder, moderate, with anxious distress was present.

846|1316|1742191P51S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|He described crying spells and feelings of worthlessness.
847|1318|1742191P51S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|"He stated, ""All the problems that I've had the last few years have seemed to reinforce that."

849|1322|1742191P51S7|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|We almost lost our house, and my mom actually gave me a loan so we could keep our house.
850|1324|1742191P51S8|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|"All of our credit cards are in collections, and it's been a little bit difficult over the last few years."""

854|1332|1742191P51S12|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Thought content included passive suicidal intent, with no plan and negative rumination.
855|1334|1742191P52S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Ultimately, the examiner opined that the Veteran does not have PTSD.
856|1338|1742191P52S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|He acknowledged the Veteran's lay statements regarding onset of symptoms but did not find them credible as his records suggest that he historically misrepresented his psychiatric history in an effort to join the Marine Corps.
857|1341|1742191P52S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Thus, while the Veteran reported that his current symptoms are related to military service, the examiner found these statements to be inconsistent with service treatment records (STRs) and his documented history.
858|1343|1742191P52S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Collateral records indicated a pre-existing history of depression, anger, and hallucinations, with symptoms apparently more severe prior to service as compared to severity during service or after his discharge.
859|1346|1742191P52S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The only aspect of his history that could have caused PTSD is childhood abuse, which does meet the stressor criterion, but other criteria for PTSD were not met in the examiner's opinion.
860|1348|1742191P52S6|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She emphatically stated that the reported in-service stressor of being sat on while doing push-ups and being punched at with fists stopping four to five inches from his face absolutely does not meet the stressor criterion for PTSD.
861|1350|1742191P52S7|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|If the criteria for PTSD were met, the examiner opined that it would be due to childhood trauma and entirely unrelated to military service.
862|1352|1742191P53S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner further explained that with regard to Dysthymic Disorder, the new diagnostic label for this condition is Persistent Depressive Disorder under DSM-5.
863|1354|1742191P53S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She opined that military service did not cause the Veteran's Persistent Depressive Disorder, as depressive symptoms, including anger and hallucinations, had their onset in childhood.
864|1356|1742191P53S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Thus, she stated it was at least as likely as not that condition existed prior to January 2010.
865|1358|1742191P53S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the examiner opined that the disorder did not progress at an abnormally high rate during the period of January 2010 through September 2010 or in March 2011.
866|1360|1742191P53S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Records are not consistent with any such aggravation, and symptoms were apparently more severe before military service than during military service or since his discharge.
867|1363|1742191P53S6|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|His symptoms before military service were so severe as to require psychiatric hospitalization as a child, and his symptoms have apparently not approached that severity since then.
868|1366|1742191P54S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|With regard to Schizotypal Personality Disorder, the examiner did not find that the Veteran has this condition.
869|1369|1742191P54S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|He did not meet diagnostic criteria, per the examiner, and if he did, she stated that this disorder is characterological in nature and would be entirely unrelated to military service.
870|1371|1742191P54S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Personality disorders are long-standing patterns of behavior and interpersonal functioning that are generally present by adolescence.
871|1374|1742191P54S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner did not find that any pre-existing Schizotypal Personality Disorder resulted in additional disability because she did not find it to be an appropriate diagnosis for the Veteran.
872|1376|1742191P54S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She also stated that he found no evidence that the Veteran currently or ever had Panic Disorder.
873|1377|1742191P55S1|1742191|False|Sentence|Analysis
874|1378|1742191P56S1|1742191|False|Sentence|"The Veteran has achieved the status of a ""veteran"" by virtue of the Board's prior decision to award service connection for a lumbar spine disorder as a result of injury he sustained during INACDUTRA from January 2010 to September 2010, and during ACDUTRA from March 7, 2011, to March 19, 2011."

876|1381|1742191P56S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition to his lumbar spine disability, he maintains that he has a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD that stems from an in-service personal assault, which he suffered during his period of ACDUTRA in March 2011.
877|1384|1742191P57S1|1742191|False|FindingSentence|After thorough consideration of the evidence of record, the Board finds that service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and depression, is not warranted.
878|1386|1742191P58S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|As an initial matter, the Board acknowledges that the Veteran's private providers have indicated a diagnosis of PTSD.
879|1388|1742191P58S2|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|However, they have not provided a discussion of how the Veteran's symptoms meet the criteria for such a diagnosis.
880|1389|1742191P58S3|1742191|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 4.125.
881|1391|1742191P58S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 Disability Benefits Questionnaire listed the diagnosis and checked off certain symptoms but provided no explanatory remarks.
882|1394|1742191P58S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2014 letter provided a list of the Veteran's symptoms and summarily stated that he met the criteria for PTSD, but there was no discussion of Criteria A-H in support of a PTSD diagnosis as laid out in DSM-5.
883|1395|1742191P59S1|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|On the other hand, the psychologist who conducted the January 2016 VA examination conducted a clinical interview and reviewed the record, to include the private treatment records, in reaching her conclusion that a diagnosis of PTSD was not appropriate.
884|1397|1742191P59S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|This examiner carefully explained why the Veteran's reported stressors and symptoms did not comport with an assessment of PTSD and addressed the applicable DSM-5 criteria.
885|1400|1742191P59S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She stated that the reported in-service stressors of being sat on while doing push-ups and being punched at with fists stopping four-five inches from his face absolutely did not meet the stressor criterion for PTSD; she further noted that if the criteria for PTSD were met, it would be due to childhood trauma and entirely unrelated to military service.
886|1402|1742191P59S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also explained that she found no evidence that the Veteran suffered from Panic Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder.
887|1404|1742191P59S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She clearly described why the Veteran's reported symptoms were more accurately assessed to be symptoms of Persistent Depressive Disorder (formerly labeled as Dysthymic Disorder).
888|1405|1742191P60S1|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|In assigning high probative value to the VA examiner's opinion, the Board notes that she had the claims file for review, specifically discussed evidence contained in the claims file including STRs, obtained a history from the Veteran, conducted a complete examination, and offered a detailed rationale with discussion of the Veteran's history and the findings of the examination in application to her conclusions.
889|1406|1742191P60S2|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no indication that the VA examiner was not fully aware of the Veteran's past medical history, including prior psychiatric diagnoses.
890|1407|1742191P60S3|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board thus finds the VA examiner's opinion to be of greater probative value than that of the private providers made without access to the full claims file and without a discussion of the relevant PTSD criteria beyond the stressors experienced in service.
891|1408|1742191P60S4|1742191|False|CitationSentence|See Prejean v. West, 13 Vet. App. 444, 448-9 (2000) (noting that factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion include the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.); Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).
892|1410|1742191P60S5|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of Persistent Depressive Disorder.
893|1412|1742191P61S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board notes that the Veteran was diagnosed with Schizotypal Personality Disorder when his service was terminated in May 1999.
894|1413|1742191P61S2|1742191|False|LegalRuleSentence|"A personality disorder is considered a ""defect"" that is not a ""disease"" or ""injury"" within the meaning of applicable legislation for VA disability compensation purposes and, therefore, cannot be service-connected."

896|1415|1742191P61S4|1742191|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, 38 C.F.R. § 4.127 provides that disability resulting from a mental disorder that is superimposed upon a personality disorder may be service-connected.

898|1418|1742191P62S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the January 2016 VA examiner stated that the Veteran does not have Schizotypal Personality Disorder as the diagnostic criteria are not met for this condition.
899|1420|1742191P62S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She found that no additional disability resulted from Schizotypal Personality Disorder because it was not an appropriate diagnosis for the Veteran.
900|1421|1742191P62S3|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|The VA examiner's findings are consistent with the November 2008 psychiatric evaluation, which concluded that it was possible that the previously reported symptomology was a product of his environment at the time and that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for the disorder with which he was previously diagnosed.
901|1423|1742191P62S4|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that there is no underlying personality disorder upon which a disability may be superimposed.
902|1424|1742191P63S1|1742191|False|Sentence|Consideration now turns to the question of whether the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder of Persistent Depressive Disorder was present prior to service.
903|1425|1742191P63S2|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the June 2009 entrance examination noted that the Veteran had a history of childhood psychiatric problems that included depression, the examination does not show that he had a diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder upon entry into service.
904|1428|1742191P63S3|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness attaches with respect to this portion of the claim.
905|1429|1742191P63S4|1742191|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1111; see also Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 286 (1994).
906|1430|1742191P63S5|1742191|False|Sentence|Thus, the burden is on VA to rebut the presumption by clear and unmistakable evidence that an acquired psychiatric disorder was both preexisting and not aggravated by service.
907|1432|1742191P64S1|1742191|False|FindingSentence|In this case, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder existed prior to service.
908|1433|1742191P64S2|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|While the Veteran's June 2009 enlistment examination was negative for diagnosis of a psychiatric disability, the Veteran reported prior depression.
909|1434|1742191P64S3|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, it was his reports of prior psychiatric treatment that resulted in his discharge from the service in May 1999.
910|1436|1742191P64S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The record reflects multiple accounts from the Veteran of anger and depression during his childhood, resulting in medication and counseling.
911|1438|1742191P64S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|In January 2010, a wavier was granted by the Marine Corps allowing the Veteran to serve despite his reports of prior depression.
912|1440|1742191P64S6|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Significantly, the VA examiner in January 2016 stated that the Veteran's Persistent Depressive Disorder existed prior to January 2010.
913|1443|1742191P64S7|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|In support of this finding, she noted childhood treatment for depression, anger, and hallucinations and stated that his symptoms were more severe prior to service than during or after service, in that they required psychiatric hospitalization.
914|1446|1742191P65S1|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board notes that the November 2008 psychiatric evaluation found no current diagnoses under Axis I or II.
915|1449|1742191P65S2|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|However, as noted by the January 2016 VA examiner, the report from this evaluation specifically stated that the Veteran wished to be found competent to join the military.
916|1452|1742191P65S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Results of the psychometric testing were deemed invalid because the Veteran endorsed items that seemed to reflect an overly positive image.
917|1455|1742191P65S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|"This ""fake-good"" response style created concern on the part of the examiner that the Veteran did not report psychiatric symptoms and functional impairment because he wanted to appear healthy enough to join the military, his primary motivation for seeking out the assessment."
918|1456|1742191P65S5|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|In light of the invalidity of the testing results, the Board affords little probative value to the findings that a psychiatric disorder was not present in November 2008.
919|1459|1742191P66S1|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Thus, while there is no evidence of a psychiatric diagnosis on the Veteran's entrance examination in June 2009, the Board finds clear and unmistakable evidence in treatment and personnel records, supported by the Veteran's statements, that an acquired psychiatric condition existed prior to his service beginning in January 2010.
920|1460|1742191P67S1|1742191|False|Sentence|The Veteran's claim now turns upon whether such preexisting acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated by service.
921|1463|1742191P67S2|1742191|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the evidence of record does not support a finding of aggravation.
922|1466|1742191P67S3|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|While the September 2014 letter from a private provider suggests a link between the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability, it is focused on direct causation rather than aggravation.
923|1468|1742191P67S4|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The January 2016 VA examiner addressed aggravation in her opinion and found that the Veteran's Persistent Depressive Disorder did not progress at an abnormally high rating during the period of January 2010 through September 2010 or in March 2011.
924|1470|1742191P67S5|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|She stated that records were not consistent with any such aggravation and symptoms were more severe during periods prior to service than during service or since his discharge.
925|1472|1742191P67S6|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that she acknowledged the Veteran's lay statements regarding the onset of his symptoms, but did not find them credible.
926|1474|1742191P67S7|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|In support of this opinion, she noted that he historically misrepresented his psychiatric history, resulting in his discharge in 1999.
927|1477|1742191P67S8|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|While the Veteran related his current symptoms to military service, the examiner found that his statements were inconsistent with STRs and his documented medical history.
928|1479|1742191P67S9|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|Collateral records indicated a pre-existing history of depression, anger, and hallucination unrelated to military service.
929|1480|1742191P67S10|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also notes that the Veteran is not currently receiving treatment for a psychiatric condition.
930|1483|1742191P67S11|1742191|False|EvidenceSentence|In a June 2017 statement, the Veteran indicated that all treatment records were associated with the record; his private treatment records end in December 2014 and there are no VA treatment records for psychiatric care.
931|1485|1742191P67S12|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the evidence of record supports a clear finding that the preexisting psychiatric disorder was not aggravated by service.
932|1486|1742191P68S1|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that the Veteran and his wife have asserted that a medical relationship exists between his current acquired psychiatric disorder and service, the Board acknowledges that they are competent to testify as to their observations.

934|1488|1742191P68S3|1742191|False|LegalRuleSentence|Lay witnesses may, in some circumstances, opine on questions of diagnosis and etiology.
935|1489|1742191P68S4|1742191|False|CitationSentence|"See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding that the Board's categorical statement that ""a valid medical opinion"" was required to establish nexus, and that a layperson was ""not competent"" to provide testimony as to nexus because she was a layperson, conflicts with Jandreau)."
936|1490|1742191P68S5|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|In the instant case, however, the Board finds that while some symptoms of the disorder may be reported by a layperson, neither the Veteran nor his wife possess the medical expertise to provide an opinion regarding its existence or etiology.
937|1491|1742191P68S6|1742191|False|LegalRuleSentence|Specifically, where the determinative issue is one of medical causation, only those with specialized medical knowledge, training, or experience are competent to provide evidence on the issue.
938|1492|1742191P68S7|1742191|False|CitationSentence|See Jones v. West, 12 Vet. App. 460, 465 (1999).
939|1493|1742191P68S8|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the Veteran and his wife's assertions that there is a relationship between his acquired psychiatric disorder and his service are not sufficient in this instance and are outweighed by other probative evidence of record.
940|1494|1742191P68S9|1742191|False|CitationSentence|Jandreau, 492 F.3d 1372.
941|1498|1742191P69S1|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board concludes that there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder preexisted service and was not aggravated during service; therefore, the presumption of soundness is rebutted.
942|1501|1742191P69S2|1742191|False|FindingSentence|The Board further finds that a discussion of whether the presumption of aggravation has been rebutted in this case under the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. § 1153 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b) is unnecessary as the Board has found by clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disability was not aggravated by service in order to conclude that there was a preexisting disorder.
943|1502|1742191P69S3|1742191|False|LegalRuleSentence|VA's General Counsel found that such a finding would necessarily be sufficient to rebut the presumption of aggravation under 38 U.S.C.A. § 1153 and 38 C.F.R. § 3.306(b).
944|1503|1742191P69S4|1742191|False|CitationSentence|Id.
945|1504|1742191P70S1|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board does not dispute that the Veteran served under stressful circumstances.
946|1505|1742191P70S2|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|However, acceptance of his account of his service does not prove that the Veteran underwent experiences that caused or aggravated a psychiatric condition, such as PTSD or depression, resulting in chronic disability.
947|1506|1742191P70S3|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|In other words, while the evidence shows that he suffered a back injury and was hazed due to his inability to deploy, this does not mean that the Veteran incurred or aggravated a chronic psychiatric disorder due to his service.
948|1507|1742191P70S4|1742191|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, while not disagreeing that the Veteran experienced the circumstances which he has described, the Board rejects the notion that his current psychiatric disorder must necessarily be conceded as being due to these in-service incidents.
949|1510|1742191P71S1|1742191|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability.
950|1511|1742191P71S2|1742191|False|Sentence|In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.
951|1514|1742191P71S3|1742191|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claims, that doctrine is not applicable.

962|1527|1710389P30S1|1710389|False|Sentence|The Veteran seeks service connection for a psychiatric disorder.
963|1529|1710389P30S2|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|He maintains that his variously diagnosed psychiatric disorder stems from the trauma of potentially being deployed to a combat zone in Vietnam while stationed in Japan during service in 1974.
964|1530|1710389P31S1|1710389|False|LegalRuleSentence|Initially, the Board notes that the scope of a mental health disability claim includes any mental disability that may reasonably be encompassed by the claimant's description of the claim, reported symptoms, and the other information of record.
965|1531|1710389P31S2|1710389|False|CitationSentence|Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).
966|1533|1710389P31S3|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran specifically identified PTSD as the claimed disability in his December 2010 claim.
967|1536|1710389P31S4|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|However, as noted in the Board's October 2014 remand, other potential psychiatric disorders reflected in the record result in a claim with a broader scope than solely PTSD.
968|1538|1710389P32S1|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran's DD FORM 214 reflects his military occupational specialty (MOS) is listed as ""DSTE"" (Digital Subscriber Terminal Equipment) maintenance repairman."
969|1541|1710389P32S2|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|Although there is no indicia of service in Vietnam, five months and 19 days of foreign service is noted, and service treatment records document service in Japan.
970|1544|1710389P33S1|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the June 1970 service entrance examination report shows that psychiatric evaluation was normal, and on the accompanying medical history, he denied having or having had depression or excessive worry and nervous trouble of any sort.
971|1546|1710389P33S2|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|A January 1973 service treatment records reflects a diagnosis of chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety.
972|1548|1710389P33S3|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the August 1974 separation examination report, which was accomplished at Yokota Air Base in Japan, reflects two episodes of chest pain diagnosed as chest wall syndrome secondary to anxiety, one of which was noted to have occurred in 1974.
973|1552|1710389P34S1|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, and although a December 2010 VA treatment record reflects an impression of PTSD based on the Veteran's detailed, self-report of numerous traumas experienced during alleged service in Vietnam, the July 2012 VA examiner clarified that the Veteran did not serve in Vietnam, noting the Veteran's admission that he never had orders to rebuild a damaged communication center in Vietnam.
974|1555|1710389P34S2|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|"""Instead, he states that his memories and nightmares are of the time he was stationed in Japan 'just sitting and waiting and anticipating you might get orders.'"
975|1558|1710389P34S3|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran recalled that he was fearful that he might be sent to Vietnam.
976|1560|1710389P35S1|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, both the July 2012 and February 2011 VA examiners specifically determined that the Veteran does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD based upon clinical testing.
977|1561|1710389P35S2|1710389|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran's VA psychiatrist noted in April 2016 that the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to his fear of deployment to high threat zones during service, with a corresponding daily fear of death, culminating in his current symptoms, which were noted to be very similar to those experienced in individuals with PTSD, the diagnosis entered was chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features, not PTSD.
978|1562|1710389P36S1|1710389|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board notes that although the Veteran is competent to report his symptoms, medical expertise is necessary to provide a diagnosis of any certain psychiatric disorder.
979|1563|1710389P36S2|1710389|False|CitationSentence|"See, e.g., Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence . . . is competent and sufficient to identify."")."
980|1564|1710389P36S3|1710389|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the probative evidence establishes that the Veteran neither served in Vietnam nor met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period.
981|1567|1710389P36S4|1710389|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted.
982|1570|1710389P37S1|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|With respect to diagnoses other than PTSD, and although a December 2011 letter from the Veteran's VA psychiatrist notes depressive disorder, not otherwise specified (NOS), the July 2012 VA examiner determined that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder.
983|1573|1710389P37S2|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the February 2015 VA examination report reflecting a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder notes that the conflict in the evidence made it difficult to determine whether the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms were related to service.
984|1575|1710389P37S3|1710389|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner added that although the Veteran may believe that his symptoms are due to his experiences during service in Japan, he likely engages in significant misattribution.
985|1576|1710389P38S1|1710389|False|ReasoningSentence|On the other hand, in addition to chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features diagnosed by the Veteran's VA psychiatrist in April 2016 and noted to be related to service, the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion states that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's recurrent manifestations of anxiety have been exacerbated by service, at least in part.
986|1579|1710389P38S2|1710389|False|FindingSentence|To the extent that the February 2017 VHA addendum opinion raises the possibility of a psychiatric disability existing prior to service entrance, in the absence of clear and unmistakable evidence showing that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance and was not aggravated by such service, the presumption of soundness at service entrance is not rebutted.

988|1583|1710389P39S1|1710389|False|FindingSentence|The evidence is in at least equipoise with respect to service connection for chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features and, when resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the Veteran has chronic adjustment disorder with depressed and anxious features related to service.

1036|1652|1705557P42S4|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|As the June 2014 VA examiner noted, this report may be misdated, as it states the Veteran is 28 years old, which is consistent with 1995.
1037|1654|1705557P43S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|In May 1995, the Veteran received acute inpatient care at the Durham VAMC for psychiatric symptoms.
1038|1656|1705557P43S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|At discharge, it was noted the Veteran had been committed to a private hospital in May 1995; the discharge diagnosis was schizophrenia with paranoid features.
1039|1658|1705557P44S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|The June 2014 VA examiner stated that under both the DSM V and DSM IV criteria, the Veteran has diagnosis of schizophrenia.
1040|1660|1705557P44S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated the schizophrenia was less likely than not incurred in or caused by service, or manifested a year after service.
1041|1662|1705557P44S3|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the examiner specified that the psychiatric disorder, which clearly and unmistakably existed prior to service, was not aggravated beyond its natural progression by an in-service event, injury or illness.
1042|1664|1705557P45S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"By rationale, the examiner stated that the Veteran clearly endorsed a history of depression and ""nervous trouble of any sort"" on an entrance Report of Medical History."
1043|1667|1705557P45S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"In the narrative explanation provided, the Veteran indicated ""anxiety-depression [secondary to] personal problems"" but denied having received any treatment for a mental health condition."
1044|1670|1705557P45S3|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|While there is little (if any) additional information available to provide context to this report, based on all other records available the examiner stated that it appears most likely he was experiencing prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia at that time.
1045|1672|1705557P45S4|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained it is quite common for people with schizophrenia to first report non-specific mental health symptoms such as depression and anxiety, as well as start to exhibit a tendency to isolate themselves from other people or present with affective flattening.
1046|1675|1705557P46S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner considered the Veteran's lay statements, including that the schizophrenia was caused by a range of possible stressors during his military service (e.g. stress of basic training, exposure to chemicals, experience of multiple motor vehicle accidents, and/or observing and experiencing many ""close calls"" while driving), however, found there is no evidence to suggest his mental health symptoms increased at any point during military service."
1047|1677|1705557P46S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|As related to the potential mental health symptoms identified by the Veteran during the present evaluation (i.e. sleep problems and headaches), there is little (if any) information to support this assertion, the examiner explained, nor would these symptoms be particularly consistent with the progression of schizophrenia.
1048|1679|1705557P46S3|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"Moreover, the discharge Report of Medical Examination (and Report of Medical History) dated August 1988 did not suggest an increase in mental health symptoms; his psychiatric condition was listed as ""normal,"" and he again endorsed ""depression or excessive worry"" and ""nervous trouble of any sort."""
1049|1682|1705557P46S4|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"While he also endorsed additional symptoms of ""frequent trouble sleeping,"" and ""periods of unconsciousness,"" he did not provide any details regarding these conditions and indicated ""...above problems resolved, no meds."""
1050|1684|1705557P46S5|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, as noted above, neither of these symptoms are particularly consistent with a progression of schizophrenia.
1051|1686|1705557P46S6|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Thus the examiner found it unlikely that the Veteran's mental health symptoms were exacerbated by his military service.
1052|1689|1705557P47S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner elaborated that when the Veteran first received treatment from the Durham VAMC in May 1995, the treatment note clearly outlined that ""...the patient's mother... reported that the patient's behavior had changed suddenly over the last 4 to 5 months."""
1053|1692|1705557P47S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|"All subsequent medical and mental health records are generally supportive of this timeline regarding the Veteran's increased psychiatric instability, and one such record, dated 1986 but likely 1995, attributes this increase to occurring ""shortly after graduating from Art college and being unsuccessful in finalizing a 'real job.'"""
1054|1694|1705557P47S3|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Provided this understanding of the etiology and course of the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, the examiner was of the clinical opinion that his prodromal schizophrenic symptoms remained relatively stable from their initial onset prior to military service until approximately late-1994 or early-1995, at which point his symptoms quickly intensified to include paranoid delusions, disorganization, irritability, increased energy, and further affective flattening and isolation from other people.
1055|1696|1705557P47S4|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|To support this hypothesis, the examiner offered that the record supports that the Veteran's mother tried unsuccessfully to have him committed for mental health treatment multiple times in the 4-5 months prior to his admission to the private hospital, thus suggesting his symptoms had not yet reached a level warranting commitment until May 1995.
1056|1699|1705557P48S1|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Of note, despite a claimed history of traumatic stressors and subsequent diagnosis of PTSD, this examiner found no records to suggest Mr. [redacted] has ever evidenced symptoms of PTSD.
1057|1702|1705557P48S2|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the traumatic stressors he endorsed, to include his reaction to those stressors, were not consistent with a Criterion A stressor as defined by the DSM V (the examiner indicated in the report that the DSM IV was also considered).
1058|1704|1705557P48S3|1705557|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner clarified that the Veteran does not meet criteria for any other mental health condition, only schizophrenia.
1059|1705|1705557P49S1|1705557|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has fully considered the Veteran's lay statements that military service aggravated his psychiatric disability.
1060|1706|1705557P49S2|1705557|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board notes that while the Veteran is competent to relay his experience, the Veteran has not been shown to be competent, by experience or training, to provide medical conclusions, especially as to complex medical diagnoses and opinions of etiology and aggravation.
1061|1707|1705557P49S3|1705557|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the Board ascribes far more probative value to the conclusions of the June 2014 VA examiner who concluded that the Veteran's schizophrenia is not caused or aggravated by service.
1062|1708|1705557P49S4|1705557|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
1063|1711|1705557P50S1|1705557|False|FindingSentence|Having carefully reviewed the record, the Board has determined that service connection is not warranted for an acquired psychiatric disorder.
1064|1712|1705557P50S2|1705557|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the evidence reveals that the Veteran currently suffers from schizophrenia, the most probative evidence of record, the VA examiner's June 2014 opinion, does not indicate the condition was caused or aggravated by service.
1065|1713|1705557P50S3|1705557|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the VA examiner's opinion provides very persuasive evidence that the schizophrenia preexisted service and was not aggravated by service.
1066|1717|1705557P50S4|1705557|False|FindingSentence|In fact, taken together with treatment records dated during and following service, the Board concludes that the record clearly and unmistakably shows that the claimed disability preexisted service and was not aggravated beyond its natural progress therein.

1070|1727|1705557P51S1|1705557|False|FindingSentence|In sum, upon careful review and weighing of the evidence, with reasoning as detailed above, the Board finds that the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the Veteran's schizophrenia preexisted service and was not aggravated therein, and that the preponderance of the evidence is against finding that any other psychiatric disability was incurred in service.
1071|1729|1705557P51S2|1705557|False|FindingSentence|The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

1317|2065|1455333P36S3|1455333|False|EvidenceSentence|"In addition, a November 2011 VA treatment record indicates that the Veteran was experiencing nightmares which were a ""product of PTSD and related to the traumas he experienced while in the Navy."""
1318|2068|1455333P36S4|1455333|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's VA treatment records constitute probative medical evidence of a link between the Veteran's PTSD and the combat related stressor.
1319|2069|1455333P36S5|1455333|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
1320|2072|1455333P37S1|1455333|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the three service connection elements under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) have been satisfied.
1321|2074|1455333P37S2|1455333|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the benefit-of-the-doubt rule applies, and service connection for PTSD is granted.

1326|2080|1549197P22S2|1549197|False|FindingSentence|Resolving all benefit of the doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric conditions, to include PTSD and depression, are related to/aggravated by the Veteran's now service-connected back condition.
1327|2081|1549197P27S1|1549197|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
1328|2082|1549197P46S1|1549197|False|Sentence|Service Connection - Acquired Psychiatric Condition, PTSD
1329|2084|1549197P47S1|1549197|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran claims, essentially, that his PTSD, or any acquired psychiatric condition, to include major depressive disorder, is due to his back condition, which has been service connected herein.
1330|2085|1549197P47S2|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has construed the claim in accordance with Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009) (observing that when determining the scope of a claim, the Board must consider the claimant's description of the claim; the symptoms the claimant describes; and the information the claimant submits or that the Secretary obtains in support of that claim).
1331|2088|1549197P47S3|1549197|False|FindingSentence|The Board notes that competent medical evidence of record, which includes a positive nexus opinion from a private psychiatrist, reveals that the Veteran's psychiatric conditions are in fact proximately caused/aggravated by the Veteran's, now, service-connected back condition.
1332|2090|1549197P47S4|1549197|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Veteran's claim for service connection must be granted.
1333|2091|1549197P48S1|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|A claim for secondary service connection requires medical evidence that connects the asserted secondary disability to the service-connected disability.
1334|2092|1549197P48S2|1549197|False|CitationSentence|See Velez v. West, 11 Vet. App. 148, 158 (1998).
1335|2093|1549197P48S3|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|In order to establish entitlement to service connection on this secondary basis, there must be (1) evidence of a current disability; (2) evidence of a service-connected disability; and (3) medical evidence establishing a link between the service-connected disability and the current disability.
1336|2094|1549197P48S4|1549197|False|CitationSentence|See Wallin v. West, 11 Vet. App. 509, 512 (1998).
1337|2095|1549197P49S1|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|A disability which is proximately due to or the result of a service-connected disease or injury shall be service connected.
1338|2096|1549197P49S2|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|When service connection is thus established for a secondary condition, the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition.
1339|2097|1549197P49S3|1549197|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.310(a).
1340|2098|1549197P49S4|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|Secondary service connection may also be established for a nonservice-connected disability which is aggravated by a service connected disability.
1341|2099|1549197P49S5|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|In such an instance, the Veteran may be compensated for the degree of disability over and above the degree of disability existing prior to the aggravation.

1343|2102|1549197P50S1|1549197|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the Veteran has provided a February 2013 private psychiatric evaluation from a board certified psychologist, Dr. J. C.
1344|2105|1549197P50S2|1549197|False|EvidenceSentence|After conducting a thorough interview of the Veteran, as well as reviewing his claims file, and medical history, the examiner noted an Axis I diagnosis of PTSD, as well as an Axis II diagnosis of major depressive disorder, with history of traumatic brain trauma.
1345|2106|1549197P50S3|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|While the examiner noted that the Veteran suffered psychologically traumatic events when he was a child, and was abused, the examiner, significantly, concluded that the Veteran's depression was aggravated by his back condition, which is now service connected.
1346|2107|1549197P50S4|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|To this end, the examiner explicitly noted that the Veteran, essentially, shuts down when his back starts hurting and just does not want to leave his bed.
1347|2109|1549197P50S5|1549197|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner concludes that this not only affects his motivation, but also would prevent him from doing any work.
1348|2111|1549197P50S6|1549197|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, he concludes that his service-connected back condition does in fact aggravate his depression.
1349|2112|1549197P51S1|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds this medical examination to be highly probative and dispositive of the inquiry at hand.
1350|2113|1549197P51S2|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|The conclusion is accurately provided, along with a rationale and full review and analysis of the medical and psychiatric history of the Veteran.
1351|2114|1549197P51S3|1549197|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, the examination report is even completed on a VA psychiatric evaluation form, VA Form 21-0960P-2; and it is the only medical opinion of record.
1352|2115|1549197P52S1|1549197|False|LegalRuleSentence|As noted above, secondary service connection can also be established if the claimed condition was aggravated by a service-connected condition.
1353|2117|1549197P52S2|1549197|False|FindingSentence|Here, the only medical evidence of record shows that the Veteran's depression, and other undistinguishable psychiatric conditions, to include PTSD, was/has been aggravated by his, now, service-connect back condition.
1354|2120|1549197P52S3|1549197|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board finds that service connection for his psychiatric conditions is warranted, and the claim must be granted.

1359|2126|1340434P33S1|1340434|False|Sentence|Service Connection
1360|2127|1340434P34S1|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|In seeking VA disability compensation, a veteran generally seeks to establish that a current disability results from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by service.
1361|2128|1340434P34S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 1131.
1362|2129|1340434P34S3|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|"""Service connection"" basically means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with active service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein."
1363|2130|1340434P35S1|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|Establishing direct service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.
1364|2131|1340434P35S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|See Davidson v. Shinseki, 581 F.3d 1313 (Fed.Cir.2009); Hickson v. West, 12 Vet. App. 247, 253 (1999); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 506 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F. 3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (table).

1367|2134|1340434P36S3|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|Further, a disability which is aggravated by a service-connected disability may be service-connected to the degree that the aggravation is shown.
1368|2135|1340434P36S4|1340434|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.310 (2012); Allen v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 439 (1995).
1369|2136|1340434P37S1|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection for PTSD requires (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred, unless the stressor is related to a Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity.
1370|2137|1340434P37S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
1371|2139|1340434P38S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that his psychiatric disorder was caused by service, or by his service-connected residuals of frostbite.
1372|2141|1340434P38S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"Specifically, in his September 2007 claim, the Veteran asserts that he never experienced mental issues before service, but ""became easily irritated and alarmed during service and it has never diminished."""
1373|2143|1340434P39S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|In his October 2007 stressor statement, the Veteran listed four stressors.
1374|2145|1340434P39S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"First, he stated that ""I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor."""
1375|2147|1340434P39S3|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"Second, he asserted that ""I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush."""
1376|2149|1340434P39S4|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"Third, he wrote that ""I witness[ed] a group of Privates giving [a] Private a G.I. Party."
1377|2151|1340434P39S5|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"(Blanket Party)....If I had turned them in then I could have been next!"""
1378|2153|1340434P39S6|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"Fourth, he averred that ""At Ft. Jackson, [South Carolina] during Basic, one of the trainees dropped a live grenade in the bunker."
1379|2155|1340434P39S7|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"This drill sergeant/Instructor jumped on it and was killed."""
1380|2157|1340434P39S8|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran concluded that those stressors made it ""hard for me to concentrate on my studies as a Tower Operator."
1381|2159|1340434P39S9|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"And that's why I failed the course."""
1382|2161|1340434P39S10|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"In February 2008, the Veteran added that ""I did receive stress counseling in service at Ft. Rucker as I was failing my course."""
1383|2163|1340434P40S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"In his October 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran added that ""my frostbite residuals...cause me much anxiety and frustration."""
1384|2168|1340434P41S1|1340434|False|FindingSentence|After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the most probative evidence is against a finding of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD; there is no credible supporting evidence that any claimed in-service stressor occurred; and the most probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of frostbite did not cause or aggravate an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.
1385|2169|1340434P42S1|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is credible, the Board may properly consider the internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran.
1386|2170|1340434P42S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
1387|2171|1340434P43S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the multiple contradictions in the Veteran's evidence lead the Board to conclude that the alleged incidents and stressors did not occur.
1388|2172|1340434P43S2|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|First, the Veteran expressly denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms in service in his April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical History, wherein he checked boxes indicating that he did not have, and had never had, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, or nervous trouble of any sort.
1389|2173|1340434P43S3|1340434|False|CitationSentence|See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than subsequently reported history).
1390|2174|1340434P43S4|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, in April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical Examination, clinicians found that the Veteran was psychiatrically normal.
1391|2175|1340434P43S5|1340434|False|CitationSentence|See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App. 221, 224 (2011) (noting that where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist).
1392|2176|1340434P43S6|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Third, the Veteran's counseling records were for academics, not stress-as the Veteran inaccurately asserted in a February 2008 letter to VA.
1393|2178|1340434P43S7|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, in a June 1977 service personnel record a counselor opined that:
1394|2182|1340434P44S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|I have personally interviewed this SM and found him to have a good attitude towards the Army.
1395|2184|1340434P44S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|However, he has a serious academic problem.
1396|2187|1340434P44S3|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|His ability to read and comprehend the material in his AIT course is extremely poor, and his exam grades indicated that he will develop[] into a marginal soldier at best.
1397|2191|1340434P44S4|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|Recommendation: I don't feel that this SM can obtain an MOS and recommend he be discharged.
1398|2192|1340434P45S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Similarly, the Veteran's own contemporaneous assessment reflected academic, rather than psychiatric, concerns, as described by an in-service supervisor in his service personnel records:
1399|2194|1340434P46S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|He says that he doesn't know what the problem is but guesses [that the test is] too hard.
1400|2196|1340434P46S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|I agree with him-it is too hard for him and he should not be in a service organization where his and other persons' lives may depend upon his ability to respond logically and rapidly to requirements.
1401|2198|1340434P46S3|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|He tried the Active Army and could not pass the tests.
1402|2199|1340434P47S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Fourth, the Veteran's stressor statements to VA clinicians and examiners are often unrelated to, or in direct contradiction with, his stressor statements in support of his claim.
1403|2201|1340434P47S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, the Veteran told a treating VA psychiatrist in September 2007 that he had not seen the recruit shoot a drill sergeant, but rather had heard about it.
1404|2204|1340434P47S3|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"This conflicts with the Veteran's October 2007 stressor statement wherein he stated that ""I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor."""
1405|2206|1340434P47S4|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, the Veteran told his treating VA psychiatrist in November 2008 that he remembered one surgeon scraping another with a metal brush in service, causing bleeding in his body.
1406|2209|1340434P47S5|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"This appears to be a variant of his October 2007 assertion that ""I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush."""
1407|2212|1340434P47S6|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, the Veteran told a VA psychologist in August 2007 that he had been revolted and horrified in service by one of his superiors who kept on his desk a large jar of pickled ears from dead NVA and Vietcong soldiers; the Veteran never listed this stressor in his claim.
1408|2213|1340434P48S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Veteran's reports of in-service incidents and stressors lack credibility.
1409|2215|1340434P49S1|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 2013, VA obtained a medical opinion as to the Veteran's claimed PTSD and psychiatric disorders.
1410|2217|1340434P49S2|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"The clinician opined that ""It is LESS LIKELY THAN NOT that the Veteran's claimed mental health condition, to include PTSD, incurred, was caused by or proximately due to his 6 months in military service."""
1411|2220|1340434P49S3|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"In support of her opinion, the clinician relied on the absence of verification of the Veteran's stressors; the in-service counseling report showing discharge due to an academic deficiency; and the absence of ""medically based scientific evidence found in his service record to indicate that his short time in military service...[was] the underlying cause of his current diagnoses of PTSD and Depression."""
1412|2222|1340434P49S4|1340434|False|EvidenceSentence|"The clinician also opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's mental health condition is caused by, proximately due to, or related to his service-connected bilateral lower extremity disabilities, to include peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease, because ""[t]here is no current literature or scientifically based medical evidence to support such a nexus."""
1413|2223|1340434P50S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the clinician's opinion is competent because she is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.
1414|2224|1340434P50S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.159(a)(1).
1415|2225|1340434P50S3|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Also, the clinician's etiological opinions are credible based on their internal consistency and her duty to provide truthful opinions.
1416|2226|1340434P50S4|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board further finds that the March 2013 clinician's opinion is most probative because she considered the Veteran's medical records and discussed his medical history, provided unequivocal and conclusive opinions, and offered clear reasoning for her conclusions.
1417|2227|1340434P50S5|1340434|False|CitationSentence|See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).
1418|2228|1340434P51S1|1340434|False|LegalRuleSentence|Where, as here, conflicting competent opinions are of record, the Board can ascribe greater probative weight to one opinion over another, provided that a rational basis is given.
1419|2229|1340434P51S2|1340434|False|CitationSentence|Winsett v. West, 11 Vet. App. 420 (1998), aff'd 217 F.3d 854 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
1420|2232|1340434P51S3|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board is cognizant of the February 2008 VA psychologist's letter, the additional VA treatment records, and the December 2012 VA examination report linking the Veteran's PTSD to his service.
1421|2233|1340434P51S4|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board accords those opinions less probative weight because they are based on acceptance of the Veteran's reported stressors which, as the Board demonstrated above, lack credibility.
1422|2234|1340434P51S5|1340434|False|CitationSentence|Id.
1423|2235|1340434P52S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|Likewise, the Board finds that the March 2013 VA medical opinion warrants greater probative weight than the Veteran's own contentions, based on the examiner's greater knowledge and expertise, as well as her greater factual accuracy in accordance with the claims file.

1425|2239|1340434P53S1|1340434|False|FindingSentence|The Board further finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) because the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD during service, did not engage in combat with the enemy, did not experience a stressor related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, was not a prisoner-of-war, and did not sustain an in-service personal assault.
1426|2240|1340434P54S1|1340434|False|ReasoningSentence|The most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, are unrelated to service or to his service-connected residuals of frostbite.
1427|2243|1340434P54S2|1340434|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, reasonable doubt does not apply, and the Veteran's appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, is denied.

1433|2251|1413417P145S1|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board notes that when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled.
1434|2252|1413417P145S2|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|As such, the Board has recharacterized the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
1435|2253|1413417P145S3|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).
1436|2255|1413417P146S1|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|While the appellant has filed a claim seeking PTSD, and has submitted a number of documents describing the military's efforts to address psychiatric combat trauma, the appellant has not actually presented any evidence to show that he has actually been diagnosed with PTSD, or even if he has, that it is in anyway related to his military service.
1437|2258|1413417P147S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant in several of his lengthy statements has suggested that several training exercises for ROTC were stressful, or that he was treated unfairly during service.
1438|2260|1413417P147S2|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|He also states studying combat tactics in ROTC classes and participating in training exercises was the same as stressors veterans in combat experience.
1439|2262|1413417P147S3|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|Even if such incidents were stressful to him, a diagnosis of PTSD would need to be based upon such an incident.
1440|2264|1413417P147S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, no such diagnosis is present.
1441|2267|1413417P147S5|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Of note, a number of psychiatric treatment records have been obtained, including from the appellant's psychiatric hospitalization in December 1990 and January 1991, but the records simply do not show that PTSD was ever diagnosed.
1442|2268|1413417P148S1|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent the appellant believes that he has PTSD from service, he lacks the medical training and expertise to address a complex medical question such as diagnosing a specific psychiatric disability.

1444|2271|1413417P148S3|1413417|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the appellant's claim for PTSD is therefore denied.
1445|2273|1413417P149S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Turning to the issue of an acquired psychiatric disorder, other than PTSD, it was noted in several service treatment records that the appellant had a history of psychiatric treatment which predated service.
1446|2274|1413417P149S2|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|The appellant has requested that the Board obtain records from this psychiatric treatment at Bayberry Hospital, but the Board concludes that such records could not serve to benefit the appellant.
1447|2275|1413417P149S3|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided).
1448|2277|1413417P150S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant was found to be psychiatrically normal at his physical examination just prior to his ROTC summer camp.
1449|2278|1413417P150S2|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the presumption of soundness does not apply to active duty for training or inactive duty for training.
1450|2279|1413417P150S3|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40 (2010).
1451|2281|1413417P150S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Regardless, even if the appellant was treated prior to his ROTC summer camp, the fact remains that there is no record of any psychiatric manifestations during the 1969 summer camp.
1452|2282|1413417P151S1|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|A previous psychiatric hospitalization might be relevant to the extent that the appellant's period of service from September to December 1970 was active duty, and he would therefore be entitled to the presumption of soundness based on the normal psychiatric profile on his physical examination in October 1970.
1453|2283|1413417P151S2|1413417|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 1111.
1454|2284|1413417P151S3|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the fact that the appellant was treated for depression prior to service would be relevant only if VA needed to rebut the presumption of soundness.
1455|2285|1413417P151S4|1413417|False|LegalRuleSentence|This is not required here, as the presumption of soundness applies only when there is manifestation of a disease or injury during service.
1456|2286|1413417P151S5|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012).
1457|2288|1413417P152S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|In this case, the appellant was repeatedly found to be psychiatrically normal on the physical examinations during his active duty service.
1458|2290|1413417P152S2|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|It is true that he reported having experienced nervousness or depression on several medical history surveys, but such notations were clarified by the medical officer to be referring to his hospitalization during college (that is prior to his active service).
1459|2292|1413417P152S3|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|A September 1970 document indicates the hospitalization had occurred three years earlier, again, prior to active duty for training in 1969, and involved a situational depression following his father's death.
1460|2295|1413417P152S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The in-service examinations found the appellant to be psychiatrically normal, and the psychiatric evaluation in September 1970 found he was fit for duty, with no residual psychiatric defects.
1461|2297|1413417P152S5|1413417|False|FindingSentence|As such, there simply is no in-service manifestation of any psychiatric problem.
1462|2298|1413417P152S6|1413417|False|Sentence|Thus, without any in-service psychiatric manifestation, the presumption of soundness does not apply.
1463|2299|1413417P152S7|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert, supra.
1464|2301|1413417P153S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Following service, the appellant has been treated for several psychiatric problems.
1465|2303|1413417P153S2|1413417|False|FindingSentence|However, no psychiatric disability has been shown to have begun during, been aggravated by, or have otherwise been caused by the appellant's brief military service.
1466|2304|1413417P153S3|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|To this end, the appellant has not specifically identified any medical professional who has made such a connection; and the appellant lacks the training and experience to render such a nexus opinion himself.
1467|2305|1413417P153S4|1413417|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
1468|2306|1413417P154S1|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, the medical evidence of record suggests other causes for the appellant's current psychiatric impairment.
1469|2309|1413417P154S2|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|In October 2010, the appellant underwent a psychological evaluation at which he reported feeling somewhat depressed and frustrated, asserting that he no longer enjoyed activities that he had previously.
1470|2311|1413417P154S3|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant was then hospitalized for two weeks in December 1990 and January 1991 for worsening depression and suicidal ideation.
1471|2313|1413417P154S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The discharge summary noted that the appellant had been experiencing increased pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 1988.
1472|2315|1413417P154S5|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that he had been treated in the 60s and 70s for depression and had received some outpatient treatment from 1974-76 following a 1973 motor vehicle accident.
1473|2317|1413417P154S6|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|He was diagnosed with depression, chronic pain, and question of organic mood disorder secondary to brain injury.
1474|2319|1413417P154S7|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|However, there was no mention of the appellant's military service.
1475|2320|1413417P154S8|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, these records suggest a cause for the appellant's psychiatric impairment that is not related to his military service.
1476|2323|1413417P155S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 1991, a LCSW (Kurgans) noted that neuropsychological testing supported a finding that the appellant had a brain injury that in all likelihood occurred when he had his accident in April 1988.
1477|2326|1413417P155S2|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 1995, she again noted that the appellant had experienced chronic pain since a motor vehicle accident in 1988, and she suggested that this accident had led to diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and organic brain syndrome.
1478|2328|1413417P155S3|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|She noted that the appellant had been seen for psychotherapy since 1990.
1479|2330|1413417P156S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant reported to her that he saw parallels between his military and post-military governmental experiences in that in both situations he did not receive sufficient support for his injuries.
1480|2331|1413417P156S2|1413417|False|Sentence|The appellant has asserted on several occasions that insufficient consideration was given to this statement.
1481|2332|1413417P156S3|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|However, what the appellant appears to be missing is that the LCSW was merely recording his contentions without lending them any medical endorsement; and, as discussed, the service treatment records do not support a finding of any psychiatric impairment during service.
1482|2333|1413417P156S4|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, while this report was considered, it does not suggest that a psychiatric disability is the result of the appellant's active duty or his active duty for training.
1483|2335|1413417P157S1|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant's mother wrote in February 2002 that the appellant had gone to Virginia State College and then served in the U.S. Army.
1484|2337|1413417P157S2|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|She asserted that he seemed to have problems dealing with stress since having gone into the service.
1485|2338|1413417P157S3|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|However, this statement does not specifically show the onset of psychiatric symptoms while the appellant was on active duty for training or active duty, or suggest that such service caused an acquired psychiatric disorder to develop.
1486|2339|1413417P158S1|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, like the appellant, his mother may be confused about what constitutes service.
1487|2340|1413417P158S2|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|"It is quite understandable that a lay person might perceive either ROTC participation or inactive service while in the Army reserves (as the appellant had from January 1970 until he was separated from the reserves in April 1974) as constituting ""military service."""
1488|2341|1413417P158S3|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|However, as explained above, neither constitutes military service for the purpose of service connection.
1489|2343|1413417P158S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the appellant was clearly hospitalized in college while in the ROTC.
1490|2345|1413417P158S4|1413417|False|EvidenceSentence|Likewise, the appellant may have experienced some psychiatric problems while still in the reserves in the wake of his motor vehicle accident in 1971 which caused significant physical limitation.
1491|2346|1413417P158S5|1413417|False|ReasoningSentence|However, he was not on either active duty or active duty for training at either time, and therefore any psychiatric manifestations during those times would not warrant service connection.
1492|2348|1413417P159S1|1413417|False|FindingSentence|As described, to the extent that the appellant currently has an acquired psychiatric disorder, it is not shown that such a condition either began during or was otherwise caused by his military service, or was in any way aggravated by such service.
1493|2350|1413417P159S2|1413417|False|FindingSentence|Rather, the appellant is frequently shown to have psychiatric problems as a result of post-service injuries.
1494|2352|1413417P159S3|1413417|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the criteria for service connection have not been met, and the appellant's claim is denied.

1499|2359|1316146P48S1|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|Since the Veteran in this case has alleged, and VA examiners have opined, that he had a psychiatric disorder that preexisted service, the Board must consider whether the presumption of soundness is for application.
1500|2361|1316146P48S2|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|In this case, service treatment records include the Veteran's June 1965 pre-induction examination and accompanying report of medical history form.
1501|2363|1316146P48S3|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|On his medical history form, the Veteran said he currently or previously had dizziness or fainting spells, foot trouble, and nervous trouble.
1502|2366|1316146P48S4|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|Concerning this history, the part of the examiner's notes that appear to address the Veteran's notation about nervous trouble is not completely legible, but he noted with regard to the dizziness or fainting spells, foot trouble, and nervous trouble as follows:
1503|2368|1316146P48S5|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|"""Occ[asional] postural hypotension"" and ""Dropped cross tie on 3rd R[ight] toe"" and ""Mildly [illegible]""."

1505|2373|1316146P48S7|1316146|False|FindingSentence|"Accordingly, because only a history of nervous trouble provided by the Veteran was shown on the entrance examination report, the Board finds that a psychiatric disorder was not ""noted"" at entry to service."
1506|2374|1316146P48S8|1316146|False|Sentence|The remaining question with regard to whether the presumption of soundness applies in this case is whether a psychiatric disorder manifested or was incurred in service.

1532|2407|1316146P57S1|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has considered the Veteran's post-service statements regarding the onset of a psychiatric disorder in service and finds that his inconsistent statements are not sufficient evidence on which to base a finding that a psychiatric disorder manifested during service.
1533|2408|1316146P57S2|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, as discussed below, none of the medical evidence indicates that a psychiatric disorder had its onset during service, and psychiatric disorders are complex matters requiring medical evidence for diagnosis; they are not the kind of disorders that subject to lay observation.
1534|2411|1316146P57S3|1316146|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board concludes that the presumption of soundness is not for application in this case with regard to a psychiatric disorder since such a disorder did not manifest in service.

1545|2422|1316146P61S1|1316146|False|LegalRuleSentence|(f)(3) If a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the veteran's service, the veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor.
1546|2423|1316146P61S2|1316146|False|LegalRuleSentence|"For purposes of this paragraph, ""fear of hostile military or terrorist activity"" means that a veteran experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others, such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device; vehicle-imbedded explosive device; incoming artillery, rocket, or mortar fire; grenade; small arms fire, including suspected sniper fire; or attack upon friendly military aircraft, and the veteran's response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or psycho-physiological state of fear, helplessness, or horror."

1611|2560|1316146P73S3|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|Unfortunately, the Board cannot consider those records for accrued benefit purposes since they are not VA records and were not associated with the claims file prior to the Veteran's death in December 2005.

1613|2563|1316146P74S1|1316146|False|FindingSentence|Based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD based on verified stressors or under the revised criteria of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(3).
1614|2567|1316146P74S2|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, while MCC Center diagnosed PTSD based on the Veteran's experiences in Vietnam, a VA or VA contracted provider did not confirm prior to the Veteran's death that his stressor was related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and that it was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
1615|2569|1316146P74S3|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the VA examination conducted one month after the letter was submitted found that the Veteran did not meet all criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.
1616|2571|1316146P74S4|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, subsequent VA PTSD screens were negative.
1617|2573|1316146P74S5|1316146|False|FindingSentence|Consequently, without a diagnosis of PTSD, service connection for PTSD for accrued benefits purposes must be denied.
1618|2575|1316146P75S1|1316146|False|FindingSentence|During the pendency of his claim, the Veteran continued to have a diagnosis of depression.
1619|2578|1316146P75S2|1316146|False|FindingSentence|However, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence does not show a relationship between depression and service.
1620|2580|1316146P75S3|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|The only evidence indicating a nexus between service and acquired psychiatric disorders are his statements.
1621|2581|1316146P75S4|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|However, as noted above, the Veteran's statements regarding the onset and treatment of his acquired psychiatric disorders are inconsistent.
1622|2583|1316146P75S5|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, he said his condition had its onset prior to service, during his first physical for basic training, upon leaving Vietnam, and after service in the 1970s.
1623|2584|1316146P75S6|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|While laypersons are generally competent to report symptoms of disorders, in this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's recollections of his medical history are not consistent and therefore, not credible.
1624|2586|1316146P76S1|1316146|False|FindingSentence|The Board has considered the medical evidence, but finds that it also fails to indicate a relationship between service and any psychiatric disorders.
1625|2588|1316146P76S2|1316146|False|EvidenceSentence|At most, VA examiners opined that acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD had their onset prior to service.
1626|2589|1316146P76S3|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinions, which are not supported by rationale, appear to be based on the Veteran's statements alleging pre-service onset of his disorders.
1627|2590|1316146P76S4|1316146|False|ReasoningSentence|However, because the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding his medical history are not credible, the Board, in turn, finds that the VA examiners' opinions are not credible or persuasive and are entitled to no probative value as they are based on the Veteran's reported history.
1628|2591|1316146P77S1|1316146|False|Sentence|Generally, the Board would remand this case to obtain an adequate VA examiner's opinion; however, because this claim is solely for the purpose of accrued benefits, the Board is not permitted to undertake development subsequent to the Veteran's death.
1629|2594|1316146P77S2|1316146|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence weighs against a finding of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, for accrued benefits purposes.
1630|2596|1316146P77S3|1316146|False|FindingSentence|The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

1638|2607|1634891P20S2|1634891|False|FindingSentence|The Veteran did not have an acquired psychiatric disorder during the period on appeal which was incurred in, or as a result of, service.

1640|2609|1634891P29S1|1634891|False|Sentence|Service Connection for an Acquired Psychiatric Disorder
1641|2610|1634891P30S1|1634891|False|Sentence|The appellant's claim is that the Veteran either incurred an acquired psychiatric disorder due to service, or that a preexisting mental health disorder was aggravated by service.
1642|2611|1634891P30S2|1634891|False|ReasoningSentence|The appeal hinges on two separate questions: first, whether a disorder clearly and unmistakably preexisted and was made worse during service; secondly, whether the Veteran had a disorder for which service-connection may be awarded at any time during the period on appeal.
1643|2614|1634891P30S3|1634891|False|FindingSentence|Because the Board finds both that the Veteran entered service in sound condition, and that he did not have a service connectable disorder during the period on appeal, the appellant's claim of service connection must be denied.
1644|2615|1634891P31S1|1634891|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection may be granted for a disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active military, naval, or air service.

1856|2985|1303141P49S1|1303141|False|Sentence|The law specific to establishing service connection for posttruamatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not discussed herein because the PTSD diagnosis is not valid.

1884|3030|1303141P54S1|1303141|False|Sentence|The Board next considers whether the presumption that the Veteran was psychiatrically sound upon his entry into service has been rebutted.

1904|3060|1303141P55S16|1303141|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the nature of that disability was schizoaffective disorder in its prodromal phases.
1905|3064|1303141P56S1|1303141|False|EvidenceSentence|Acknowledgement is given to the Veteran's contentions during the pendency of the claim that the ultimate conclusion from his pre-service hospitalization for psychiatric symptoms was simply that he needed to grow up or that he was depressed.

1948|3126|1303141P61S3|1303141|False|EvidenceSentence|His psychiatric disability, which was characterized as chronic, was deemed to have been prompted by the stresses and strains of adult life prior to service.

1950|3130|1303141P61S5|1303141|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, it was determined that stress other than from service probably would have resulted in a psychotic episode requiring hospitalization like the in-service episode from the stress of service which required hospitalization.

2048|3287|1455570P40S3|1455570|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, as the Veteran served in combat, his lay statements are sufficient to verify his in-service stressors.
2049|3288|1455570P41S1|1455570|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board acknowledges that there is competent evidence both for and against a finding that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disorder related to his in-service combat stressors.
2050|3290|1455570P41S2|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychologist in January 2011 provided a detailed history and comprehensive report of his examination in which he acknowledged the combat events and found that they met the traumatic event criteria.
2051|3292|1455570P41S3|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|However, he found that the Veteran did not have any diagnosed psychiatric disorder on that one occasion, but did not have access to or mention the nature of the VA outpatient care that was provided prior to his examination.
2052|3294|1455570P42S1|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|On the other hand, outpatient clinicians in 2010 diagnosed depression and possible PTSD, albeit with little detailed rationale.
2053|3296|1455570P42S2|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|Nevertheless, the clinicians acknowledged the combat events as well as the death of the Veteran's first wife, his workplace injuries and surgery, and his involuntary retirement.
2054|3298|1455570P42S3|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|In 2012, the outpatient clinicians affirmatively diagnosed mild symptoms of depression and PTSD without conditional language, but again with little detailed analysis or rationale, referring to both physical disabilities as a cause for depression and combat events as causes for nightmares, intrusive memories, and irritability.
2055|3301|1455570P42S4|1455570|False|EvidenceSentence|However, beginning in February 2013, VA treatment records reflect diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.
2056|3304|1455570P42S5|1455570|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, the Veteran's testimony regarding a 2013 intensive mental health treatment program for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which he reported had been related to his in-service combat stressors, is competent and credible in light of his ongoing treatment for such disorders.
2057|3308|1455570P43S1|1455570|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, resolving all doubt in favor of the Veteran, the Board finds that the competent and credible evidence shows that diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder were rendered during portions of the pendency of the Veteran's claim and such were, at least in part, related to traumatic events during combat in Vietnam.
2058|3310|1455570P43S2|1455570|False|FindingSentence|Consequently, service connection for such acquired psychiatric disorders is warranted.

2314|3729|1554465P60S7|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, she reported being raped by three other women.
2315|3732|1554465P60S8|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported that she reported this incident to her commanding officer but no action was taken.
2316|3734|1554465P61S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|"She indicated that boot camp was ""fine."""
2317|3737|1554465P61S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|"She stated that she was named ""outstanding recruit of the platoon"" and that she received her first rank out of boot camp."
2318|3739|1554465P61S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported psychiatric problems since her military discharge.
2319|3741|1554465P61S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined that the Veteran met the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD due to sexual assault that she suffered while on active duty.
2320|3743|1554465P61S5|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported audiovisual hallucinations of her rapists and other Marines.
2321|3745|1554465P61S6|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She reacted with intense fear and helplessness.
2322|3748|1554465P61S7|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She had nightmares about the rape, reported dissociative states in which she feels as if she is reliving her rape and defending herself.
2323|3749|1554465P61S8|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|This evidence is favorable to, but not dispositive of, the claim.
2324|3751|1554465P62S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|A September 2002 VA mental health note reflects she had a tenuous living situation.
2325|3753|1554465P62S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She was unable to pay her rent, utilities, and food.
2326|3755|1554465P62S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She was noted to be in treatment at the Women's Program for PTSD.
2327|3757|1554465P62S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The impression was depressive disorder, history of psychosis, stable, inadequate housing and history of PTSD, currently being treated.
2328|3759|1554465P62S5|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|An October 2002 outpatient report was consistent with the September 2002 report.
2329|3761|1554465P63S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|At VA psychiatric examination in November 2002, the Veteran reported that in May 1969 she was on guard duty in the family barracks at Camp Pendleton when three females attacked her and performed sexual acts.
2330|3763|1554465P63S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She called for help, but no one came.
2331|3765|1554465P63S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She wrote a note in the company logbook indicating that an incident had occurred, but she did not give any details.
2332|3768|1554465P63S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She also reported the incident to her commanding officer and provided the names of the individuals involved.
2333|3770|1554465P63S5|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She was not referred to a hospital and did not seek psychiatric help.
2334|3772|1554465P64S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She also recounted a helicopter crash at Camp Pendleton, during her reserve service, in which one of her roommates was killed.
2335|3774|1554465P64S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She recalled finding a finger lying near the crash site.
2336|3776|1554465P64S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Eight Marines were killed.
2337|3778|1554465P65S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner assigned a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features.
2338|3780|1554465P65S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that, despite the history of mixed depressive and psychotic symptoms dating back 10 to 15 years, the Veteran had held a job successfully until approximately two years earlier.
2339|3783|1554465P65S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The criteria for diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was not met, the examiner concluded, because it was not clear that she ever had a distinct period of two weeks when the psychotic symptoms persisted but she was free of mood symptoms.
2340|3785|1554465P65S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined, in essence, that no current psychiatric disorder was linked to the Veteran's service or any incident thereof.
2341|3786|1554465P65S5|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinion is well reasoned and provides an accurate summary of the record.
2342|3787|1554465P65S6|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinion is persuasive evidence against the claim.
2343|3789|1554465P66S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|A January 2003 VA PTSD outpatient report noted that the Veteran discussed several motor vehicle accidents in which she was involved.
2344|3791|1554465P66S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported an incident in the military in which she fell from a vehicle and slid 50 feet into an intersection.
2345|3793|1554465P66S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She stated that anxiety attacks were a barrier to driving.
2346|3795|1554465P66S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|This treatment note provides a description of a stressor not previously reported.
2347|3797|1554465P67S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran has not provided additional information as to the possible date or location of a motor vehicle accident referenced in the January 2003 treatment notes.
2348|3799|1554465P67S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|She has not indicated when or where she was treated for injuries sustained in such a motor vehicle accident in the 10 years since she mentioned such a stressor.
2349|3801|1554465P67S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran has not provided any additional details which could be used to verify the motor vehicle accident.
2350|3802|1554465P67S4|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the treatment note is unfavorable to the claim, since it is not consistent with any prior information and is not clarified or further described in any later stressor account.
2351|3804|1554465P68S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|SSA awarded the Veteran disability benefits in a favorable 2003 decision.
2352|3806|1554465P68S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The award letter provides no discussion of a specific stressor or a link between the Veteran's service and an acquired psychiatric disability.
2353|3807|1554465P68S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|This award, and the underlying medical evidence, provides no additional information that is favorable or unfavorable to the claim.
2354|3809|1554465P69S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|An April 2003 VA outpatient note indicates that the award of SSA disability benefits reminded the Veteran of past hardships including being raped, homeless, unemployed, and depressed.
2355|3811|1554465P69S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|This event led to a resurgence of memories associated with the rape, including the name of one of her attackers, T., as well as a woman who later helped protect her from the rapists, E.
2356|3813|1554465P69S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The social worker who authored the note indicated that memories of her rape appeared to have been the core of the Veteran's current dysphoria.
2357|3814|1554465P70S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|This treatment note raises additional inconsistencies in the information provided by the Veteran.
2358|3817|1554465P70S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran told the provider she remembered names of two servicemembers involved in the incident, the Veteran has never provided any name of a fellow former servicemember for purposes of development of her claim for compensation.
2359|3819|1554465P70S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|Her statements at the April 2003 VA treatment visit are inconsistent with her actions since that time.
2360|3820|1554465P70S4|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|That inconsistency undermines her credibility.
2361|3821|1554465P71S1|1554465|False|Sentence|The Board has considered all the evidence of record regarding an alleged sexual assault that the Veteran reports occurred during her active service.
2362|3822|1554465P71S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that no service department records of the incident have been located does not weigh against the possible occurrence or the Veteran's credibility, since VA regulations recognize that such incidents, if reported, were not uniformly documented.
2363|3824|1554465P71S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in the October 2003 stressor statement, the Veteran stated that she could not remember the names of any individuals involved.
2364|3825|1554465P71S4|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|That report is in conflict with the April 2003 treatment report.
2365|3827|1554465P72S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that she had symptoms of a psychiatric disability soon after her discharge from active duty and soon after reserve service was completed.
2366|3828|1554465P72S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran is competent to report events during active service.
2367|3829|1554465P72S3|1554465|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.
2368|3830|1554465P72S4|1554465|False|CitationSentence|"See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (""a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered"") and credibility (""a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"")."
2369|3831|1554465P72S5|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The evidence of record contradicts the Veteran's assertion of chronic psychiatric symptoms or disability or symptoms or disability due to psychosis during a presumptive period.
2370|3832|1554465P73S1|1554465|False|LegalRuleSentence|In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.
2371|3833|1554465P73S2|1554465|False|CitationSentence|Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498 (1995).
2372|3834|1554465P73S3|1554465|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.
2373|3835|1554465P73S4|1554465|False|CitationSentence|Buchanan v. Nicholson, 451 F.3d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006).
2374|3836|1554465P74S1|1554465|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board may not ignore a veteran's testimony simply because he or she is an interested party and stands to gain monetary benefits; personal interest may, however, affect the credibility of the evidence.
2375|3837|1554465P74S2|1554465|False|CitationSentence|Cartright v. Derwinski, 2 Vet. App. 24, 25 (1991).
2376|3839|1554465P74S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran provided varying accounts of stressor events to VA adjudicators and treatment providers during the lengthy pendency of the appeal.
2377|3840|1554465P74S4|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|Given the inconsistencies between the Veteran's reports and the objective evidence of record, the Veteran's credibility is diminished.
2378|3841|1554465P75S1|1554465|False|Sentence|The Veteran's service personnel records are associated with the claims file.
2379|3843|1554465P75S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Review of the service personnel records shows no indication of disciplinary actions, adverse personnel actions, drop in performance, or requests for reassignment.
2380|3845|1554465P75S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|During active service she states that she was awarded the outstanding recruit award, her August 1969 performance evaluation was excellent.
2381|3847|1554465P76S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported, at the November 2002 VA examination, that she enjoyed both active service and reserve service.
2382|3850|1554465P76S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported that she chose to be discharged from active service in August 1969 due in part to the sexual abuse, but her performance obviously did not deteriorate in any way due to the alleged assault.
2383|3852|1554465P76S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Importantly, in August 1969, just three months after the alleged sexual assault occurred in May 1969, the Veteran received an excellent performance review.
2384|3854|1554465P77S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran enlisted in 1983 for six additional years of reserve service and was promoted.
2385|3856|1554465P77S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Her reserve component service performance record was also excellent and unblemished.
2386|3858|1554465P77S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|It reflects only high achievement and excellent work ethic.
2387|3860|1554465P77S4|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Significantly, VA outpatient treatment records from 2000 and 2001 do not contain any allegation of any kind of military sexual trauma or abuse.
2388|3863|1554465P77S5|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002, after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
2389|3865|1554465P77S6|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, prior to August 2002, the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors, to include the helicopter crash, seeing dead bodies, and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam.
2390|3866|1554465P77S7|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|This is not necessarily significant in and of itself, yet, combined with the other credibility evidence of record; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.
2391|3868|1554465P78S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was referred to the VA Mental Health Clinic in September 2002 following a positive military sexual trauma and PTSD screening.
2392|3870|1554465P78S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|It was at that time she was diagnosed with PTSD due to the military sexual trauma.
2393|3872|1554465P78S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|In contrast, the VA psychiatrist who conducted November 2002 VA examination, two months later, concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.
2394|3873|1554465P78S4|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also points out that the examiner had access to and reviewed the Veteran's claims file, to include her prior psychiatric diagnoses, hallucinations, and alleged stressors.
2395|3874|1554465P78S5|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|As noted above, the November 2012 VA examination report is lengthy, accurate, and provides the reasoning for the examiner's conclusions.
2396|3875|1554465P78S6|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|In contrast, the VA psychologist who provided the September 2002 diagnosis did not reference review of any records, but, rather, assigned a diagnosis based upon the Veteran's account of her own history.
2397|3876|1554465P79S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|Also probative regarding the Veteran's credibility is the fact that she has told different examiners different facts regarding her history.
2398|3878|1554465P79S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|At the November 2002 VA exam, she stated that in 1987 approximately she started feeling depressed.
2399|3880|1554465P79S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|At the September 2002 PTSD examination, she stated that she has been having mental health issues ever since service.
2400|3881|1554465P80S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The various psychiatrists and psychologists who have noted PTSD as due to military sexual trauma appear to have done so based only on the Veteran's self-reported history, rather than review of the complete record.
2401|3882|1554465P80S2|1554465|False|LegalRuleSentence|A medical professional's opinion based on a post-service examination of a veteran is not competent evidence that an in-service stressor occurred.
2402|3883|1554465P80S3|1554465|False|CitationSentence| Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 145 (1997); Moreau, 9 Vet. App. 389, 395-96.
2403|3884|1554465P81S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|To the degree that the medical providers have based their opinions on the Veteran's self-reported accounts of military sexual trauma, the Board has found such reports to be not credible, and it follows that medical opinions based on such reports are not probative.
2404|3885|1554465P81S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, because such medical opinions are not based on review of the evidence they do not constitute verification of military sexual trauma under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(4).
2405|3886|1554465P82S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|As a layperson, the Veteran can certainly provide an account of her symptoms and feelings at any given time.
2406|3887|1554465P82S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|However, service personnel records, and later reserve service records in particular, weigh heavily against the Veteran's September 2002 account that she has had mental health problems ever since her active service.
2407|3888|1554465P82S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|As mentioned previously, the stellar performance evaluation reports during her reserve service generally negate the contention that mental health problems, such as psychosis, were present at that time.
2408|3890|1554465P83S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the Veteran has claimed that her PTSD is a result of a stressor involving her witnessing and picking up human remains of Marines who had been killed in a helicopter crash in Camp Pendleton.
2409|3891|1554465P83S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|This stressor is a major event, yet remains unverified after all attempts.
2410|3892|1554465P84S1|1554465|False|Sentence|While the case was on remand status following the 2009 Remand from the Board, the RO was instructed to accomplish all development action in order to corroborate the stressor.
2411|3895|1554465P84S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The RO acquired a Command Chronology from the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California from July 1968 through December 1968; no helicopter crash was reported.
2412|3897|1554465P85S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran then provided statements indicating that, during her reserve service, in 1990, she performed post-crash duties at the site of a helicopter crash in which two female Marines were ""torn to pieces."""
2413|3898|1554465P85S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|No objective confirmation of this stressor has been located.
2414|3899|1554465P85S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|It is not credible that a helicopter crash in 1990 which resulted in fatalities would not have been documented by the service department or the base at which it is alleged to have occurred, or that no other information, such as a newspaper article, reports of aviation accidents, or the like, would be located.
2415|3900|1554465P86S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds it very probative that the Veteran has described vividly remembering witnessing a crash involving either 2 (October 2004 VA outpatient records), 8 (November 2002 VA examination), or 13 (October 2000 VA Mental Health Clinic outpatient records, Addendum) dead Marines, to include her roommates, yet there is no objective confirmation of the event.
2416|3903|1554465P86S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|"In particular, the Board notes the Veteran's statements that ""the media"" reported on this crash, but their reports were inaccurate."
2417|3904|1554465P87S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|"If the alleged incident had been reported in ""the media,"" as the Veteran has described, it would be expected that objective information about the incident could be located on the Internet, if not from the service department."
2418|3905|1554465P87S2|1554465|False|CitationSentence|"See, e.g., Bureau of Aircraft Accident Archives, http://www.baaa-acro.com/ (archive of information about aviation accidents, listing more than 23,300 events); Los Angeles Times, Collections, ""Helicopter Accidents Marine Corps, US,"" http://articles.latimes.com/keyword/helicopter-accidents-marine-corps-u-s."
2419|3906|1554465P87S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The absence of any objective corroboration of the alleged helicopter crash with fatalities is highly unfavorable to the Veteran's contention that she picked up human remains following such an accident.
2420|3907|1554465P88S1|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran is a sympathetic claimant.
2421|3908|1554465P88S2|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The record establishes that the Veteran performed her active service honorably and well, and was highly regarded during her reserve component service.
2422|3909|1554465P88S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The pursuit of this claim for the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal establishes that the Veteran sincerely believes that a current psychiatric disorder is linked to her service.
2423|3911|1554465P89S1|1554465|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence is unfavorable to the claim.
2424|3913|1554465P89S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The available service personnel records, although incomplete, show no indictors of a stressor, such as disciplinary problems or behavioral changes.
2425|3914|1554465P89S3|1554465|False|ReasoningSentence|The lay and medical records are inconsistent with the Veteran's assertion that she had chronic mental health disability symptoms following her active or reserve service.
2426|3917|1554465P90S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|The AMC issued a March 2011 memorandum summary of actions taken in attempt to corroborate the Veteran's alleged PTSD stressors.
2427|3919|1554465P90S2|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|It was concluded that exhaustive attempts failed to corroborate a stressor and no further development should be conducted.
2428|3922|1554465P90S3|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran suggests that it is possible that this crash may have occurred shortly after the Veteran was called up on reserve duty after Desert Storm began in 1991, there simply is no record of 2, 8, or 13 Marines perishing in a helicopter accident at Camp Pendleton at that time either.
2429|3923|1554465P90S4|1554465|False|CitationSentence|See http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1991.htm and http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/Chronologies/Yearly/1992.htm.
2430|3925|1554465P91S1|1554465|False|EvidenceSentence|With regard to psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, the Veteran is diagnosed with depressive disorder with psychotic features and has been receiving SSA disability benefits for severe major depression since August 12, 2001.

2459|3966|1741477P28S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|With respect to the existence of a present disability, various acquired psychiatric disorder diagnoses are of record.
2460|3968|1741477P28S2|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Specifically, the existence of a present disability is established through the Veteran's medical treatment records and an October 2008 mental conditions examination report and April 2012 PTSD VA examination report produced during the course of this appeal.
2461|3969|1741477P28S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the October 2008 VA examiner endorsed a diagnosis of anxiety disorder NOS (mixed anxiety-depression).
2462|3972|1741477P28S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence| A November 2008 VA treatment record endorsed a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed mood, and a January 2009 VA treatment record endorsed diagnoses of anxiety disorder NOS and depressive disorder NOS.
2463|3974|1741477P28S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The April 2012 VA PTSD examination diagnosed mood disorder, NOS with depressive symptoms.
2464|3976|1741477P28S6|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A May 2013 VA treatment record noted a diagnosis, in part, of anxiety disorder, NOS and depressive disorder, NOS.
2465|3978|1741477P28S7|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2014 VA treatment record, noted in part, diagnoses unspecified anxiety disorder and unspecified depressive disorder in accordance with the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DMS) 5.
2466|3980|1741477P28S8|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|December 2014 and January 2015 VA treatment records provided an assessment, in part, of unspecified anxiety disorder; unspecified depressive disorder, rule out for PTSD, as well as unspecified personality disorder, with antisocial and borderline features.
2467|3982|1741477P28S9|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2015 VA treatment record noted a diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features.
2468|3983|1741477P29S1|1741477|False|Sentence|The Board recognizes that this appeal was remanded in December 2014 and September 2016 in order to obtain an additional psychiatric examination.
2469|3984|1741477P29S2|1741477|False|Sentence|However, the Veteran failed to report to such an examination, but did indicate, in a March 2017 statement, a willingness to report for one in the future.
2470|3988|1741477P29S3|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Nonetheless, the Boards finds the evidence is adequate to establish that the Veteran has an acquired psychiatric disability, variously diagnosed as anxiety disorder, NOS, adjustment disorder with mixed mood, depressive disorder NOS, mood disorder, NOS with depressive symptoms, and major depressive disorder, which meets the first requirement to establish service connection.
2471|3989|1741477P30S1|1741477|False|Sentence|The next element to establish service connection is evidence of an in-service incurrence of injury or disease.
2472|3991|1741477P30S2|1741477|False|FindingSentence| In this regard, the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder must be deemed to have been incurred or aggravated during service.
2473|3992|1741477P30S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The material issues of fact at this point are (a) whether the disorder preexisted any period of active service and (b) whether the disorder underwent any degree of aggravation during active service.
2474|3993|1741477P31S1|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Next, the Veteran's currently diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorder, must be deemed to have been incurred or aggravated during service.
2475|3994|1741477P31S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The material issues of fact at this point are (a) whether the disorder preexisted service and (b) whether the disorder underwent any degree of aggravation during service.
2476|3997|1741477P32S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|An acquired psychiatric disorder was not noted at the Veteran's June 2006 Report of Medical Examination for enlistment in the Army National Guard is checked normal with respect to the psychiatric category.
2477|3999|1741477P32S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran was found fully fit in examinations titled ""Initial Medical Review Annual Medical Certificate"" conducted in January 2007, February 2007, and July 2007."

2479|4004|1741477P32S4|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Because a psychiatric disorder was not noted at service entrance, the presumption of soundness applies.
2480|4005|1741477P32S5|1741477|False|CitationSentence|See McKinney v. McDonald, 28 Vet. App. 15, 22-23 (2016).
2481|4009|1741477P33S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|However, although the Veteran, in August 2014 testimony, argued that his acquired psychiatric disorder did not preexist service and onset in his second period of service, from July 2007 to July 2008 with service in Iraq, the Board finds that clear and unmistakable evidence establishes that his acquired psychiatric disorder preexisted service.
2482|4011|1741477P33S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, the October 2008 mental conditions examiner reported the Veteran described his father as physically and mentally abusive, as drug addict, and his mother as an enabler and also physically abusive toward the Veteran as a child.
2483|4013|1741477P33S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|He also reported that one of his sisters died when he was 12 years old after she was hit by a car.
2484|4016|1741477P33S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The October 2008 mental conditions examiner documented that the Veteran reported that after his sister was killed he felt depressed about her death, was anxious about school and things in general, occasionally had butterflies in his stomach but no full-blown panic attacks.
2485|4018|1741477P33S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran stated he slit his wrists at age 21 in an attempt to commit suicide but told medical personnel that he injured himself in a roofing accident.
2486|4020|1741477P33S6|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, he did not report any history of mental health treatment prior to military service.
2487|4022|1741477P33S7|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, the October 2008 VA examiner stated, in pertinent part, that the Veteran appeared to have had onset of anxiety depression and ethanol (ETOH) abuse in adolescence before active duty.
2488|4024|1741477P34S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The April 2012 VA PTSD examiner reported, in part, that what was most clear was that the Veteran has had a complex and troubled history, with a predominant treatment issue of heroin dependency.
2489|4026|1741477P34S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The April 2012 VA PTSD examiner noted the Veteran also had several traumatic events happen before and after his military service but the Veteran appeared to be minimizing the significance of those events.
2490|4028|1741477P34S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, the April 2012 VA examiner noted that when the Veteran was 12 years old, his 14 year old sister, described as his best friend, was killed when the Veteran was present and he expressed a great deal of grief and guilt for many years because of this.
2491|4030|1741477P34S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|He further reported physically abusive and emotionally unavailable parents as a child and described domestic abuse in the home resulting in police intervention.
2492|4032|1741477P34S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the April 2012 VA examiner, in part, noted that numerous factors, other than in-service stressors, better accounted for the Veteran's mood symptoms and among those reasons included an emotionally neglectful childhood, being a witness of domestic abuse in childhood, and the traumatic death of his sister in childhood.
2493|4035|1741477P35S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Thus, based on the October 2008 and April 2012 examination reports, the Board finds it has been established that an acquired psychiatric disorder clearly and unmistakably preexisted service.
2494|4036|1741477P35S2|1741477|False|CitationSentence|See Harris v. West, 203 F.3d 1347, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2000); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 237-38 (2012); see also Doran v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 283, 286 (1994).
2495|4038|1741477P35S3|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the first prong of the presumption is rebutted.
2496|4040|1741477P36S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|There is not clear and unmistakable evidence that a preexisting acquired psychiatric disorder was not aggravated by service.
2497|4041|1741477P36S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|To the contrary, the record reflects a medical opinion on this question, which indeed essentially found the Veteran's preexisting acquired psychiatric disorder was aggravated by service.
2498|4044|1741477P36S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, the October 2008 examiner stated it was most likely that Veteran's mental health issues were exacerbated by his military service in Iraq, although the examiner provided a caveat, which was that it was very difficult to ascertain the diagnostic picture in the context of active drug/ETOH abuse problems and suggested that Veteran have another mental disorders examination upon completion of treatment for chemical dependency.
2499|4046|1741477P37S1|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|There are no other medical opinions of records which address the claim on the basis of aggravation of a preexisting disability.
2500|4048|1741477P37S2|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, based on the current evidence of record, it cannot be concluded that there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was not aggravated by service as it is a debatable point on which reasonable minds could disagree.
2501|4049|1741477P37S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, the October 2008 VA examiner provided a finding that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated by his active service. 
2502|4052|1741477P37S4|1741477|False|FindingSentence|In light of this finding, the presumption of soundness is not rebutted, and the preexisting schizophrenia must be considered service-incurred.
2503|4053|1741477P37S5|1741477|False|CitationSentence|See Horn, 25 Vet. App. at 235.
2504|4055|1741477P38S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the second element of the service connection claim, service incurrence of a disease, is established.
2505|4057|1741477P39S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Finally, the evidence tends to make it at least equally likely that the Veteran's current symptoms related to his acquired psychiatric disorder are related to the symptoms he experienced during his second period of active service.
2506|4059|1741477P40S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|As alluded to above, the April 2012 VA examiner opined that it was less likely as not that the Veteran's mood disorder, NOS with depressive symptoms, was related to claimed stressors.
2507|4061|1741477P40S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The April 2012 VA examiner stated that putting aside the concerns about the Veteran's inconsistencies, there were numerous other factors that better accounted for his mood symptoms and among those reasons were chronic drug dependency, an abusive emotionally neglectful childhood, being a witness of domestic abuse in childhood, the traumatic death of his sister in childhood and his mother's death from cancer shortly after father's suicide.
2508|4064|1741477P40S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the April 2012 VA examiner noted the Veteran reported the onset of symptoms two years ago and denied mood problems before 2010.
2509|4067|1741477P41S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, a June 2012 examiner noted the Veteran completed a Reserve Health Readiness Program questionnaire in July 2009 and indicated a number of symptoms that would be consistent with a mood disorder.
2510|4069|1741477P41S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the June 2012 VA examiner noted the questionnaire was not probative with regard to the cause of these symptoms or their relationship to his current disorder.
2511|4071|1741477P41S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, the June 2012 VA examiner stated that as to whether or not the symptoms noted on the questionnaire were related to the Veteran's current diagnosis of mood disorder, NOS, could not be answered without resorting to speculation
2512|4073|1741477P42S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran in August 2014 testimony, through his representative, argued he has had problems with his everyday life since his service in Iraq.
2513|4075|1741477P42S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|In a July 2012 statement, accepted as a substantive appeal, the Veteran reported, in part, that during his active service he was scared and went through things that changed his life forever and that he did not feel normal anymore.
2514|4077|1741477P42S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, medical records dated shortly after the Veteran's deployment reflected the existence mental issues.
2515|4079|1741477P42S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|In this regard, in an October 2008 Post Deployment Health Re-Assessment, dated only a few months after separation from active service in July 2008, the Veteran reported feeling down depressed or hopeless for a few or several days and also reported he felt numb or detached from others activities or his surroundings.
2516|4081|1741477P42S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2008 VA treatment record diagnosed anxiety disorder, NOS, heroine abuse, ETOH abuse, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) abuse and ruled out substance induced mood disorder.
2517|4083|1741477P42S6|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Ongoing mental issues are also reflected in other service records, dated subsequent to active service.
2518|4085|1741477P42S7|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, in a June 2009 service treatment record, titled Periodic Health Assessment, the Veteran endorsed multiple mental health symptoms.
2519|4087|1741477P42S8|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|This assessment also noted mental health concerns of anxiety and depression.
2520|4090|1741477P42S9|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted by the June 2012 VA examiner, a July 2009 Reserve Health Readiness Program noted the results of June 2009 Periodic Health Assessment.
2521|4091|1741477P42S10|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The close temporal proximity between the Veteran's separation from his second period of active service and the report of psychiatric problems also weighs in favor of a finding of service-connection and supports the Veteran's contention that such psychiatric symptoms are a continuation of symptoms from active service.
2522|4094|1741477P43S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|By resolving all reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record establishes that a preexisting psychiatric disorder increased in severity during his second period of active service.
2523|4096|1741477P43S2|1741477|False|FindingSentence|The presumption of aggravation applies which has not been rebutted.

2550|4125|1741477P49S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the Veteran contends that he incurred PTSD during active service.
2551|4127|1741477P49S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|During an April 2012 VA PTSD examination, and in other statements, the Veteran reported a stressor of being part of a convoy taking enemy fire and that improvised explosive devices were detonated around him.
2552|4129|1741477P49S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|He also stated that someone on a passing convoy was hurt or killed from an improvised explosive device.
2553|4131|1741477P49S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|In an October 2013 statement, the Veteran reported that he was in a convoy enemy fire that took enemy fire and he further reported that he received enemy fire when changing a light bulb.

2558|4138|1741477P50S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|As the Veteran has filed a specific claim for PTSD in January 2012, he believes he has a current disability of PTSD.
2559|4140|1741477P50S6|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran is a lay person because there is no indication from the evidence that he has a medical background.
2560|4141|1741477P50S7|1741477|False|LegalRuleSentence|A lay person is competent to diagnose a disability only if competent to identify it, if describing symptoms that support a later medical diagnosis, or if there is a contemporaneous medical diagnosis.

2564|4145|1741477P51S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|PTSD, in contrast, is not simple and readily observable.
2565|4146|1741477P51S4|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|There indeed are no external symptoms like there are for the aforementioned disabilities.
2566|4147|1741477P51S5|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Although at least some internal symptoms may manifest behavior that is observable, they may be caused by a number of different diagnoses of which PTSD is only one.
2567|4148|1741477P51S6|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran has not been shown to have the requisite knowledge or expertise to be deemed competent to diagnose PTSD.
2568|4149|1741477P51S7|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The evidence, particularly VA treatment records, indeed shows that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD, but also with various psychiatric disorders other than PTSD, such as depression and anxiety, as addressed in the discussion above.
2569|4150|1741477P52S1|1741477|False|LegalRuleSentence|It is also reiterated that whether a stressor is sufficient to support a PTSD diagnosis is a determination to be made by a medical professional.
2570|4151|1741477P52S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, PTSD is not a disability a lay person is competent to identify.
2571|4152|1741477P52S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran has described his psychiatric symptoms and is competent in this regard because he personally experiences these symptoms.

2573|4154|1741477P52S5|1741477|False|LegalRuleSentence|Various factors are used to gauge the credibility of competent lay evidence.
2574|4155|1741477P52S6|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the credibility of the Veteran in making symptom descriptions is undisputed.
2575|4158|1741477P53S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Notwithstanding the Veteran's competent and credible psychiatric symptoms descriptions, the preponderance of the evidence does not show that they support a later medical diagnosis of PTSD.
2576|4160|1741477P53S2|1741477|False|FindingSentence|The preponderance of the evidence also does not show a contemporaneous medical diagnosis of PTSD.
2577|4161|1741477P53S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|There is conflicting evidence about whether or not the Veteran ever has had PTSD, much less has it as a current disability.
2578|4162|1741477P53S4|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|In other words, the weight of the evidence overall is against a finding that he had PTSD during the pendency of the claim or proximate to the claim.
2579|4163|1741477P53S5|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence| Moreover, there is also uncertainly regarding the Veteran's reported stressors as such have not been verified; however, as diagnosis of PTSD has not been provided in conjunction with such, the Board need not discuss such further.
2580|4167|1741477P54S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|In this regard, a November 2008 VA medical treatment record noted, in part, the Veteran reported distressing dreams of being in Iraq but did not indicate having combat related nightmares or dreams, indicated being anxious when in Iraq, however, the treatment record noted this was a normal response and further noted the Veteran denied hypervigilance and excessive startle response.
2581|4169|1741477P54S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2008 VA treatment record further found there were no ongoing symptoms of PTSD although there were clear memories of specific incidents and as described above, in part, endorsed a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed mood.
2582|4172|1741477P54S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A March 2011 VA treatment record noted PTSD symptoms as evidenced by irritability and hypervigilance but did not endorse a diagnosis of PTSD.
2583|4174|1741477P55S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A January 2012 VA treatment record noted the Veteran was recently diagnosed with PTSD but indicated an assessment/plan, in part, of PTSD/depression and that the Veteran was going through some emotional challenges, as both parents died within the past year and that he was being followed by mental health.
2584|4176|1741477P55S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore a January 2012 VA treatment record specific for a PTSD evaluation specifically ruled out a diagnosis of PTSD, even with consideration of the Veteran's reported stressors and symptoms.
2585|4178|1741477P55S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, another February 2012 VA treatment record did note the testing was reviewed with the Veteran and did report that he had PTSD.
2586|4179|1741477P55S4|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the January 2012 and February 2012 VA treatment records do not provide a decisive diagnosis of PTSD.
2587|4182|1741477P55S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, an April 2012 VA treatment record noted anxiety disorder NOS, PTSD symptoms with report of time course discrepant from previous notes regarding the onset of symptoms, especially nightmares, panic symptoms, social anxiety, which were atypical in that the latter had come and gone; however, such did not actually endorse a diagnosis of PTSD.
2588|4184|1741477P56S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A May 2013 VA treatment record, noted in pertinent part, that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD at the current time.
2589|4187|1741477P56S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|An October 2014 VA treatment record endorsed a diagnosis of PTSD; however, such was, the record noted, based on the Veteran's exposure to traumatic events during volatile childhood that involved witnessing his father physically and emotionally abuse his mother as well as due to traumatic events serving on active duty with the National Guard in Iraq.
2590|4188|1741477P56S3|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the October 2014 record did not clearly related the diagnosis to the Veteran recounted military stressors but in fact linked such in part to his childhood.
2591|4190|1741477P56S4|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|November 2014 VA treatment records noted a diagnosis of PTSD as an active problem based on a computerized list but did not discuss recounted military stressors.
2592|4192|1741477P56S5|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Another November 2014 VA treatment record stated, in part, that the Veteran's psychological profile was characterized by both emotional and behavioral dysfunction, including depression, anxiety, substance use, aggressive behavior, and interpersonal and identity disturbance and the latter was best captured by a diagnosis of unspecified personality disorder with features of antisocial and borderline features.
2593|4194|1741477P56S6|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the November 2014 VA treatment record, further stated the presence of significant substance use made it difficult to discern the exact nature of his psychological difficulties and based on his history of trauma both in and out of the military, further evaluation of PTSD was recommended once he had obtained a longer period of sobriety but specifically ruled out PTSD in accordance with the DMS-5.
2594|4196|1741477P57S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|December 2014 and January 2015 VA treatments noted, in part, that a diagnosis of PTSD was ruled out.
2595|4197|1741477P57S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|"However, another January 2015 VA treatment record endorsed a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with the DSM-5; however, the basis of such was not apparent as the record did not address any in-service stressors and also noted in part that the Veteran had served one year jail time ""in the cell next to Jeffrey Dahmer"" which he reported was unnerving and traumatizing."
2596|4199|1741477P57S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2015 VA treatment record again noted a diagnosis of PTSD with anxious features but did not discuss the basis of such and did not indicate if such was in accordance with the DSM.
2597|4203|1741477P58S1|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was provided a VA mental conditions examination in October 2008 and the VA examiner did not endorse a diagnosis of PTSD, but did endorse another acquired psychiatric diagnosis as described above.
2598|4207|1741477P58S2|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, the Veteran was also afforded an April 2012 VA PTSD examination and the VA examiner did not endorse a diagnosis of PTSD that conformed to the DSM-IV criteria based on the evaluation, but did endorse another acquired psychiatric diagnosis as described above.
2599|4209|1741477P58S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, the April 2012 VA examiner found Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under DSM-IV criteria even with consideration of the Veteran's reported stressor.
2600|4210|1741477P59S1|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|For the reasons detailed above, the aforementioned diagnoses of PTSD, in sum, carry very minimal probative weight.
2601|4211|1741477P59S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, the opinions of the October 2008 and April 20212 VA examiners were predicated on a full overview of the entire relevant record and were presented by examiners who were specifically tasked to provide psychiatric diagnoses after review of the evidence.
2602|4213|1741477P59S3|1741477|False|EvidenceSentence|The October 2008 and April 2012 VA examiners examiner explained and documented the Veteran's report of symptoms and did not endorse a diagnosis of PTSD.
2603|4215|1741477P59S4|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, these VA examiners' opinions are entitled to substantial probative weight.
2604|4216|1741477P59S5|1741477|False|CitationSentence|See Nieves-Rodriguez, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008).
2605|4219|1741477P60S1|1741477|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence does not show that the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD for VA purposes.
2606|4220|1741477P60S2|1741477|False|ReasoningSentence|A diagnosis of PTSD was not endorsed by the October 2008 or June 2012 VA examiners and other diagnoses have been determined to lack probative value.
2607|4223|1741477P60S3|1741477|False|FindingSentence|Thus, based on the reasons and bases discussed, the Board has considered the benefit of the doubt doctrine, but does not find that the evidence is of such approximate balance as to warrant its application.

2651|4295|1334312P104S2|1334312|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's reports of in-service events are not credible.
2652|4297|1334312P104S3|1334312|False|EvidenceSentence|There are two DD Form 214s of record, one for period of active service from July 1980 to July 1984 and one for the period from January 1985 to January 1988.
2653|4299|1334312P104S4|1334312|False|EvidenceSentence|For the period from July 1980 to July 1984, he had one year, one month, and twenty-seven days of foreign service and his awards for that period include a sea service deployment ribbon.

2655|4302|1334312P104S6|1334312|False|ReasoningSentence|This is evidence against a finding that he ever served in Okinawa during the period that he reports such service.
2656|4303|1334312P104S7|1334312|False|ReasoningSentence|This is inconsistent with his reports noted above.

2664|4315|1334312P106S2|1334312|False|ReasoningSentence|The most probative evidence shows that his reports of his service are not credible and therefore the July 2010 psychological evaluation report and the August 2010 chiropractor report are afforded only the most minimal of probative weight.
2665|4317|1334312P106S3|1334312|False|EvidenceSentence|His service treatment records include numerous normal clinical psychiatric evaluations documented in reports of medical examination over the course of his military service.

2667|4323|1334312P106S5|1334312|False|FindingSentence|The Board therefore concludes that the preponderance of evidence shows that the in-service element of service connection is not met with regard to any psychiatric disability claim, including whether service connection is warranted for a mood disorder.

2751|4456|1456911P52S1|1456911|False|Sentence|The remaining question, therefore, is whether there is competent medical evidence linking the Veteran's PTSD to his in-service stressor.

2767|4481|1632746P25S1|1632746|False|Sentence|The Veteran believes he is entitled to service connection for PTSD.
2768|4484|1632746P25S2|1632746|False|FindingSentence|For the following reasons, the Board finds service connection is warranted.
2769|4485|1632746P26S1|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection will be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred in or aggravated by active service.

2771|4487|1632746P26S3|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|Establishing service connection generally requires competent evidence of three things: (1) a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship, i.e., a nexus, between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the current disability.

2779|4495|1632746P29S1|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|"The evidence necessary to establish the occurrence of a stressor during service to support a diagnosis of PTSD will vary depending upon whether the Veteran engaged in ""combat with the enemy,"" as established by recognized military combat citations or other official records."
2780|4496|1632746P29S2|1632746|False|CitationSentence|See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128 (1997).
2781|4497|1632746P29S3|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|"If VA determines the Veteran engaged in combat with the enemy and the alleged stressor is combat-related, then the Veteran's lay testimony or statement is accepted as conclusive evidence of the stressor's occurrence and no further development or corroborative evidence is required, provided that such testimony is found to be ""satisfactory""-i.e., credible, and ""consistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of service."""

2783|4499|1632746P29S5|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|If, however, the Veteran's stressor is unrelated to participation in combat, then lay testimony, in and of itself, is insufficient to corroborate the stressor.
2784|4500|1632746P29S6|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|The record must contain credible supporting information from an independent source that corroborates his testimony or statements, such as service records.

2786|4502|1632746P30S1|1632746|False|Sentence|Apart from the above provisions, VA revised the regulation governing adjudication of claims for service connection for PTSD, effective July 13, 2010.

2788|4504|1632746P30S3|1632746|False|Sentence|The revised regulation essentially eases the requirement that there be corroboration of a claimed in-service stressor.
2789|4505|1632746P30S4|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|Under this standard, if a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, provided the stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the stressor.
2790|4506|1632746P31S1|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.

2795|4513|1632746P32S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran explained his PTSD worsened in 2000, when he switched from working night shift to day shift, and he was forced to frequently interact with co-workers and family members.
2796|4515|1632746P32S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The stress of such interactions increased his temper, and he became verbally abusive toward his family members.
2797|4517|1632746P32S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Shortly thereafter, he entered treatment at the VA and enrolled in private mental health services where he was diagnosed with depressive disorder and PTSD.
2798|4519|1632746P33S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran informed the examiner he dreamed often, but only occasionally about Vietnam.
2799|4521|1632746P33S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Following his discharge, he often awoke from sleep screaming and in a panicked state, and he still experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam.
2800|4523|1632746P33S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, he was forced to actively avoid veteran associations or discussions of combat.
2801|4525|1632746P33S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|He tended to avoid crowds or groups of people because of feelings of potential danger or threat and heightened anxiety.
2802|4527|1632746P33S5|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|He avoided others out of a fear of losing control and angry impulses.
2803|4529|1632746P33S6|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Lastly, he experienced trouble controlling his temper and struggled to interact with others at work and with his family.
2804|4531|1632746P33S7|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Socially, the Veteran maintained one or two friendships.
2805|4533|1632746P34S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner determined the Veteran was alert and oriented to all spheres.
2806|4535|1632746P34S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|His appearance was clean, and he was adequately dressed and groomed.
2807|4537|1632746P34S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|His speech was coherent and of a normal rate, rhythm, and tone.
2808|4539|1632746P34S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|He displayed good eye contact and demonstrated appropriate interpersonal interaction.
2809|4541|1632746P34S5|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|His thought process was logical and goal directed, and he exhibited no overt or reported signs of psychosis, delusion, or hallucination.
2810|4543|1632746P35S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner concluded that the Veteran suffered from both PTSD and a depressive disorder.
2811|4545|1632746P35S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's experiences in Vietnam served as his traumatic stressor.
2812|4547|1632746P35S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner believed the Veteran's PTSD developed following his discharge from the service.
2813|4548|1632746P36S1|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|Following the examination, the Veteran was consistently and continuously diagnosed with PTSD, continued to report symptoms of PTSD, and continuously received both in-patient and out-patient PTSD counseling from 2002 until 2009.
2814|4550|1632746P37S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 2007, the Veteran submitted a statement, concluding that his PTSD caused him to mentally break down at VA hospitals, receive disciplinary charges at work, and forced him to undergo hospitalization for psychiatric care in January 2005.
2815|4552|1632746P38S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 2009, the Veteran underwent a C&amp;P examination for PTSD.
2816|4554|1632746P38S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran did not complete the exam due to his mental angst.
2817|4557|1632746P38S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Prior to the examination, the Veteran had asked for and received from his treating psychologist a note stipulating that his wife should be allowed to attend the C&amp;P examination with him.
2818|4559|1632746P38S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Upon arriving for the C&amp;P examination, the examiner informed him his wife was not allowed to attend.
2819|4561|1632746P38S5|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|This upset the Veteran to such a degree the examiner was forced to end the examination.
2820|4564|1632746P39S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a statement in which she concluded her father's PTSD had worsened over the past few months, and she was very worried about his anger.
2821|4567|1632746P39S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|She stated that she never knew what was going to happen around him, and although he continued to receive treatment at the VA, his condition had worsened, not improved.
2822|4570|1632746P40S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 2012, the Veteran received another C&amp;P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.
2823|4572|1632746P40S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|She concluded that the Veteran did not meet PTSD criteria under the DSM-IV Criteria B (re-experiencing), Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), or Criteria D (hyperarousal).
2824|4574|1632746P40S3|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner indicated that under Criteria B (re-experiencing), the Veteran did not suffer from recurrent distressing thoughts of the event, or recurrent distressing dreams of the event.
2825|4576|1632746P40S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Under Criteria C (avoidance and numbing), the Veteran did not actively avoid activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma.
2826|4578|1632746P40S5|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Under Criteria D (hyperarousal), the examiner indicated the Veteran did not suffer from irritability or outbursts of anger.
2827|4581|1632746P40S6|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner could not explain why the Veteran had been diagnosed with PTSD by past treatment providers because she could not review how those providers arrived at a diagnosis.
2828|4583|1632746P40S7|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Lastly, she opined that the Veteran merely suffered from isolated symptoms of PTSD which were not sufficient to make a PTSD diagnosis under the DSM-IV.
2829|4586|1632746P41S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In June 2012, the Veteran submitted a statement explaining that he had received continuous PTSD diagnoses for the past 10 to 12 years, and he continued to suffer from the disease.
2830|4587|1632746P42S1|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board begins by noting that due to the Veteran's combat service in Vietnam, the RO conceded the existence of in-service stressors.
2831|4589|1632746P42S2|1632746|False|FindingSentence|Thus, a discussion concerning stressors is unnecessary.
2832|4592|1632746P43S1|1632746|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the evidence supports the Veteran's claim of service connection for PTSD.
2833|4593|1632746P43S2|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|First, the record demonstrates the Veteran served in Vietnam, and the RO conceded that the Veteran's in-service stressors occurred.
2834|4594|1632746P43S3|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, the Veteran's VA treating physicians believe the Veteran suffers from PTSD.
2835|4595|1632746P43S4|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|For more than the past decade, the Veteran has complained of and sought treatment for PTSD, and the providers whom the Veteran saw on a daily basis concluded the Veteran suffered from PTSD.
2836|4596|1632746P43S5|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|Last, the October 2002 C&amp;P examiner diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD and concluded that the Veteran's PTSD stemmed from his service in the military.
2837|4599|1632746P44S1|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 2012, the Veteran underwent a C&amp;P examination for PTSD, in which the examiner concluded the Veteran did not suffer from PTSD.
2838|4601|1632746P44S2|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In making this finding, the examiner determined the Veteran did not suffer from the following: recurrent distressing thoughts of the event; recurrent distressing dreams of the event; an avoidance of activities, places, or people that arouse recollections of the trauma; or irritability or outbursts of anger.
2839|4602|1632746P44S3|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|The record, however, directly contradicts those findings.
2840|4604|1632746P44S4|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In the October 2002 statement, the Veteran informed the examiner he experienced daily, recurrent thoughts of Vietnam, occasional nightmares, and that he actively avoided veterans and activities associated with Vietnam.
2841|4607|1632746P44S5|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the Veteran explained to the examiner that he frequently suffered from irritability and anger outbursts with his family and co-workers, and the Veteran continued to assert that in his lay statements.
2842|4609|1632746P44S6|1632746|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 2009, the Veteran's daughter submitted a letter to the RO in which she stated she was worried about her father's worsening anger, unpredictability, and irritability.
2843|4610|1632746P44S7|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|Due to the fact that the March 2012 examiner mischaracterized the Veteran's symptoms and behavior, the Board finds the examination and examiner's conclusion less than probative.
2844|4611|1632746P44S8|1632746|False|CitationSentence|See Reonal v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 458, 460-61 (1993) (finding that medical opinions based on incomplete or inaccurate factual premises are not probative).
2845|4614|1632746P45S1|1632746|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, given the Veteran's treating physicians' multiple diagnoses of PTSD, the Board finds the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and its relation to service.
2846|4615|1632746P46S1|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|In addition to the general requirements for service connection, PTSD claims require: (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition; (2) a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and (3) credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressor occurred.
2847|4616|1632746P46S2|1632746|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).

2850|4619|1632746P47S1|1632746|False|ReasoningSentence|In this situation, the evidence establishes the Veteran has (1) medical evidence diagnosing the condition; (2) the October 2002 C&amp;P examiner determined the Veteran's PTSD traumatic stressor concerned his experience in Vietnam with a mortar attack; and (3) the RO has conceded that the Veteran's claimed in-service stressor occurred.
2851|4620|1632746P47S2|1632746|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
2852|4623|1632746P48S1|1632746|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds the evidence concerning service connection to PTSD is at least in equipoise.
2853|4624|1632746P48S2|1632746|False|LegalRuleSentence|When there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding any issue material to the determination of a matter, VA shall give the benefit of the doubt to the claimant.

2891|4669|1554166P47S1|1554166|False|FindingSentence|At the outset, the Board points out that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the claim and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.
2892|4670|1554166P47S2|1554166|False|CitationSentence|See McClain, supra; Romanowsky, supra.
2893|4673|1554166P47S3|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|"In this regard, October 2008 VA treatment records document ""PTSD-type symptoms"" and one clinician indicated the need to ""rule out PTSD"" as a diagnosis."
2894|4675|1554166P47S4|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, PTSD-like symptoms and a history of PTSD were noted during treatment in November 2008.
2895|4676|1554166P47S5|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|However, despite these notations, there is no indication in the record that the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or private clinician, nor was he diagnosed with PTSD by the VA psychologist who conducted the March 2015 examination.
2896|4678|1554166P48S1|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|Conversely, review of the record reveals that the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including:  unspecified depressive disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), personality disorder NOS, and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.
2897|4680|1554166P48S2|1554166|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the first requirement for establishing service connection, a current disability, has been met.
2898|4683|1554166P49S1|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's service treatment records reveal no treatment for or diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder, and his separation examination revealed no psychiatric abnormalities.
2899|4685|1554166P49S2|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, there is no evidence the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with a psychosis.
2900|4687|1554166P49S3|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in written documents and in his Board hearing testimony, the Veteran contends that his acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of witnessing a shipmate fall overboard while stationed on the USS Constellation CVA 64 in approximately March 1975.
2901|4690|1554166P49S4|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|While the AOJ attempted to verify such stressor, it was unsuccessful.
2902|4691|1554166P49S5|1554166|False|LegalRuleSentence|Thus, to establish service connection, there must be probative evidence linking his currently diagnosed psychiatric disorders with any instance of his military service.
2903|4694|1554166P49S6|1554166|False|FindingSentence|Upon review of the evidence, the Board finds the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.
2904|4696|1554166P50S1|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|In this regard, in March 2015 the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in connection with his claim for service connection.
2905|4698|1554166P50S2|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|Following an interview with the Veteran, a review of the record, and a mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed an unspecified depressive disorder and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.
2906|4702|1554166P50S3|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted the Veteran's reports that he received mental health treatment in service, but noted (as does the Board) that there is no indication of such treatment in the Veteran's service treatment records.
2907|4705|1554166P50S4|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also noted the Veteran's reports of being fearful in service and his unverified stressor of seeing a fellow sailor fall overboard.
2908|4708|1554166P50S5|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|"Nevertheless, the examiner opined that the Veteran's depressive disorder was not related to his service and that his depressive symptoms are related to a ""long history of personality features and/or his substance abuse history."""
2909|4709|1554166P51S1|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached.
2910|4710|1554166P51S2|1554166|False|CitationSentence|See Nieves-Rodriguez, supra (holding that it is the factually accurate, fully articulated, sound reasoning for the conclusion that contributes to the probative value of a medical opinion); Stefl, supra.
2911|4711|1554166P51S3|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no competent medical evidence to the contrary.
2912|4712|1554166P52S1|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent the Veteran believes that he suffers from a psychiatric disorder that is related to service, as a lay person, he has not shown that he has specialized training sufficient to render such an opinion.
2913|4713|1554166P52S2|1554166|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (noting general competence to testify as to symptoms but not to provide medical diagnosis).
2914|4714|1554166P52S3|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the diagnosis and etiology of psychiatric disorders are matters not capable of lay observation, and require medical expertise to determine.
2915|4715|1554166P52S4|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|Accordingly, his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence.
2916|4716|1554166P52S5|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.
2917|4719|1554166P53S1|1554166|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran's drug abuse history.
2918|4720|1554166P53S2|1554166|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, both 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.301(a) and 3.301(d) prohibit service connection for diseases incurred during active military service resulting from the abuse of drugs.
2919|4721|1554166P53S3|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|As any disease resulting from his abuse of illegal drugs is not considered to be in the line of duty pursuant to 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d), service connection for a depressive disorder as a result of illegal drug use in service cannot be established.
2920|4722|1554166P53S4|1554166|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.301(a).
2921|4725|1554166P54S1|1554166|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the Board finds that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders arose in service or are etiologically related to service or any incidents therein.
2922|4727|1554166P54S2|1554166|False|FindingSentence|Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with a psychosis within a year of his separation from service.
2923|4729|1554166P54S3|1554166|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
2924|4730|1554166P55S1|1554166|False|ReasoningSentence|In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
2925|4733|1554166P55S2|1554166|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.

2944|4755|1713615P34S1|1713615|False|LegalRuleSentence|In order to rebut the presumption of sound condition, VA must show by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence both (1) that the disease or injury existed prior to service and (2) that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.

2987|4824|1713615P43S5|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board acknowledges that the Veteran's psychiatric health history is a complex one, and that different mental health providers have provided differing opinions as to the diagnoses relating to the Veteran's symptoms.
2988|4826|1713615P44S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatric examination reports of September 2009 and April 2011 were completed in connection with the Veteran's claim for a psychiatric disability, specifically PTSD.
2989|4828|1713615P44S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|During his September 2009 VA examination, the Veteran reported being physically and emotionally abused as a child, and building a bomb with the intention of killing his stepfather.

2992|4834|1713615P44S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2009 VA  examiner opined that the record and observation were consistent with diagnoses of psychosis (by history), alcohol abuse, and a personality disorder.
2993|4836|1713615P45S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|During his April 2011 VA psychological evaluation, the Veteran reported a childhood history of physical abuse, substance abuse, hearing voices telling him to beat-up people, a suicide attempt at age 16, and explosive behavior, which resulted in his being expelled from school.

2995|4840|1713615P45S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|He reported that some of his siblings and his parents suffered from bipolar disorder and alcoholism.
2996|4842|1713615P45S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner opined that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for PTSD, but rather he exhibited preexisting (pre-service) symptoms of psychosis (paranoia), not otherwise specified; impulse control disorder, not otherwise specified; a mood disorder, not otherwise specified; and a personality disorder, not otherwise specified; which were less likely than not the result of or exacerbated by military service.
2997|4844|1713615P46S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The January 2013 private psychiatric evaluation report concluded that the correct current diagnosis for the Veteran is schizoaffective disorder, a condition the Veteran was predisposed to genetically.
2998|4846|1713615P46S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The report discussed the Diathesis Stress Model of Illness, where a predisposition to a particular illness will more likely than not manifest itself during periods of extreme stress, and addressed the complexities of diagnosing psychiatric disorders generally.
2999|4848|1713615P46S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner interviewed the Veteran's aunt, half-brother, and the Veteran's current girlfriend.
3000|4851|1713615P46S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's aunt and half-brother confirmed that the Veteran was abused by his step-father, and stated that they did not see evidence of alcohol or drug use prior to his military service.
3001|4853|1713615P46S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|They reported that prior to his military service, he was quiet and did not get into trouble, but after his return from service, his half-brother reported that the Veteran was frequently in trouble, and that he drank and did drugs.
3002|4856|1713615P46S6|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran's girlfriend met him after his return from service, and stated that he was ""unstable,"" then, but has become more stable recently."
3003|4858|1713615P46S7|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined that it is at least as likely as not that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder began during his service, due to the stress of his posting in Germany, near the East German border during the Cold War.
3004|4860|1713615P46S8|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, the examiner opined that the Veteran used alcohol and drugs as a form of self-medication.
3005|4861|1713615P47S1|1713615|False|Sentence|The June 2013 VA psychiatric opinion report was provided in response to the specific questions raised on appeal of the Veteran's claim for service connection, and addressed remand questions with references to the evidence of record.
3006|4864|1713615P47S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The two VA psychiatric evaluators opined that the Veteran had a preexisting psychiatric condition prior to enlistment, and that the evidence of record did not show aggravation of those disabilities.
3007|4866|1713615P47S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA examiners cited the evidence of record as supporting the finding that the majority of the Veteran's symptom exacerbations have been associated with substance use, and that a ""diagnosis of substance induced mood and psychotic disorder could account for his periodic symptom presentations."""
3008|4868|1713615P47S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|They noted that by DSM-IV-TR criteria, primary psychotic, mood and anxiety disorders cannot be definitively diagnosed when patients are using substances.
3009|4871|1713615P48S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|With regard to the opinions of the January 2013 psychiatric evaluation, they noted that the report's exclusion of the impact of the Veteran's extensive substance abuse history led them to disagree with the symptom timeline and attribution.
3010|4873|1713615P48S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, the January 2013 report discounted the relevance of the Veteran's pre-service symptoms throughout, took the Veteran's statements at face value, and did not account for numerous contributors recorded in the file.
3011|4875|1713615P49S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The June 2013 VA report provided a concise narrative of the Veteran's history, concluding that the Veteran's ""symptoms appear to be multifactorial with contributions from an abusive upbringing, biological predisposition, chronic substance use and antisocial personality traits present since his teen years and mood, thought, anxiety disorders present since a teenager prior to military service, noted in the military and exacerbated with substance use following discharge from the military."
3012|4877|1713615P49S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"His disability is related to all of these factors, both preexisting and persisting, and not to a single diagnosis or precipitant, in isolation."""
3013|4878|1713615P50S1|1713615|False|Sentence|The March 2015 private psychological test report was requested by the Veteran's attorney in order to address the Veteran's current diagnosis, whether his preexisting psychiatric disability was aggravated by service, and whether he used alcohol and drugs as a form of self-medication for his psychiatric symptoms while on active duty.
3014|4880|1713615P50S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner identified the primary diagnosis as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, with other psychiatric conditions present, including polysubstance use disorder in full remission, alcohol use disorder in sustained full remission, unspecified anxiety disorder, mild neurocognitive disorder due to multiple etiologies (substance abuse/cardiovascular incident), provisional, and physical abuse of a child as victim.
3015|4883|1713615P51S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The March 2015 examiner found it ""clearly evident"" that the Veteran had ""some mental health problems prior to his enlistment,"" and opined that it was ""at least as likely as not that the disability was aggravated by service."""
3016|4885|1713615P51S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the report did not identify any specific pre-service psychiatric disabilities, other than to say that in light of the physical altercations in high school, oppositional defiant disorder would have been an appropriate diagnosis.
3017|4887|1713615P51S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"With regard to the question of aggravation of preexisting psychiatric disabilities, the examiner stated, ""[t]here is certainly NO clear and unmistakable evidence that his condition was not aggravated during service."""
3018|4889|1713615P51S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner stated elsewhere in his report that ""given [the Veteran's] history, it is incomprehensible that an individual who had these preexisting conditions would not have experienced an exacerbation of his symptoms by his time in the military service."
3019|4892|1713615P51S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"Having been through basic training myself, which was a stressful experience, it is easily construed that [the Veteran's] symptoms, given his preexisting issues, would have been exacerbated to a significant level."""
3020|4893|1713615P52S1|1713615|False|Sentence|Pursuant to the December 2014 Joint Motion, the Board remanded the matter in June 2015 to obtain a VA psychiatric addendum opinion specifically addressing whether the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability was aggravated by service.
3021|4894|1713615P52S2|1713615|False|Sentence|The resulting November 2015 VA psychiatric addendum report addressed the remand directives in light of the evidence of record, to include the March 2015 private psychiatric evaluation report.
3022|4895|1713615P53S1|1713615|False|Sentence|The June 2015 Board remand specifically requested an opinion as to whether in-service complaints of hypersomnia and insomnia were manifestations of a preexisting psychiatric disorder.
3023|4898|1713615P53S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The November 2015 VA examiners opined that ""it is more likely than not that the claimant had a sleep disruption prior to service, according to his 3/6/1979 record."
3024|4900|1713615P53S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|It is more likely than not that [the Veteran] had anxiety prior to service, according to the 1/25/1980 record.
3025|4902|1713615P53S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The sleep disruption may or may not have been related to anxiety, substance use or another diagnosis, but it is speculation to make the association because both were not concurrent complaints in service."""
3026|4906|1713615P53S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|In support of this opinion, the November 2015 VA examiners noted that the Veteran denied psychiatric symptoms (and sleep problems) at his entry examination, yet less than one month later, in March 1979, he reported that he experienced hypersomnia over the preceding two years, hence, prior to service.
3027|4908|1713615P53S6|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, in January 1980, he reported a two-year history of chest pain, which would have put the onset of symptoms prior to enlistment.
3028|4910|1713615P53S7|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The November 2015 VA examiners noted that ""functional chest pain,"" identified on the January 1980 service treatment record is an anxiety-related disorder."
3029|4913|1713615P54S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"As to the question of whether the Veteran's in-service complaints of hypersomnia and/or insomnia, if found to be manifestations of a preexisting psychiatric disorder, constituted an increase in severity of that psychiatric disorder, the November 2015 VA examiners opined that it was more likely than not that the Veteran had a ""persistence"" of the preexisting sleep disruption in service, similar to prior to service, according to the April 2011 VA examination record, which documented the Veteran's report that he had experienced sleep problems throughout his lifetime."
3030|4915|1713615P54S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiners stated that it would be speculative to assess whether in-service sleep disruption constituted an increase in severity, as symptom frequency and duration were not specified in the records relating to sleep symptoms.
3031|4918|1713615P55S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"In providing an opinion as to whether any preexisting psychiatric disorder underwent an increase in severity during service, the VA examiners identified polysubstance dependence and learning disabilities, as well as auditory command hallucinations and impulse control issues (to include suicide attempt and school expulsion), and opined that the identified ""symptoms can be associated with substance use or can occur apart from substance use."
3032|4921|1713615P55S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"A record from a childhood evaluation was not provided, so whether he had a preexisting formal psychotic or mood disorder that was present, or whether the symptoms occurred independent of substance use both would be speculation."""
3033|4924|1713615P56S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiners addressed the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric conditions identified in their June 2013 and November 2015 opinions, and supported their conclusions as to whether these conditions were shown to have been aggravated during service from the evidence of record.
3034|4926|1713615P56S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, they found that the Veteran reported continued and increased use of substances during service.
3035|4928|1713615P56S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The record shows a persistence of a conduct disorder/personality disorder as evidenced by frequent altercations with other service members and disorderly conduct, though it is not known to have increased as compared to prior to service.
3036|4930|1713615P56S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|His preexisting psychosis was not noted in service.
3037|4932|1713615P56S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|According to the record, his mood disorder and anxiety did not increase during service.
3038|4934|1713615P57S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2015 VA examiners noted that following his discharge from service, the Veteran worked from 1980 to 1988 in a number of positions.
3039|4936|1713615P57S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|During that period, there were no medical records indicating ongoing exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms.
3040|4938|1713615P57S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|It was not until 1988 that he was diagnosed with substance, psychotic, mood, and personality disorders.
3041|4940|1713615P58S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The November 2015 VA examiners found that ""[t]he absence of psychosis or mood symptoms or schizoaffective diagnosis in the 1980 exit exam, or by his report, illustrates no aggravation of his preexisting symptoms."
3042|4942|1713615P58S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The post-discharge timeline, an 8 year period of work without treatment records indicates clear and unmistakable evidence that his condition was not aggravated during service."""
3043|4944|1713615P59S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Importantly, the November 2015 VA examiners provided a statement of the evidence that would have shown aggravation of the preexisting psychiatric disorder.
3044|4949|1713615P59S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|These include:  (1) The absence of or limited childhood/teen problems before service and the presence of new symptoms during service with continuation immediately following service, (2) A report of psychosis by the [Veteran] during service or at the time of discharge, (3) Observation of psychosis on interim or exit exams, (4) A report of symptoms, diagnosis, treatment or lack of functioning in the period immediately following or shortly after discharge.
3045|4951|1713615P59S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2015 VA examiners found none of these indications in the record.
3046|4954|1713615P59S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, they found that in contrast to the presence of such evidence of aggravation during service, the record shows that the Veteran's symptoms appear some eight years later, in the form of substance use and psychosis.
3047|4957|1713615P60S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding the avoidance of speculative opinions, the November 2015 VA examiners noted that the March 2015 private report appears to speculate about the reason no psychosis symptoms were reported by the Veteran during service.
3048|4959|1713615P60S2|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The March 2015 private examiner stated that the Veteran did not report his symptoms for fear of being discharged from the military.
3049|4962|1713615P60S3|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the November 2015 VA examiners noted that he did not report any psychotic symptoms on the exit interview, despite the fact that he knew he was being discharged.
3050|4964|1713615P60S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, during service and upon examination for discharge, he reported other symptoms that could have resulted in discharge, such as chest pain.
3051|4966|1713615P60S5|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"The November 2015 VA examiners noted that an ""alternate explanation for the absence of reported symptoms by the claimant or in the record is that if psychotic symptoms were present during the time of service, the claimant would have reported them during or at the end of his service when being examined."""
3052|4969|1713615P61S1|1713615|False|FindingSentence|Having carefully considered the Veteran's claim for service connection in light of the evidence of record and the applicable law, the Board concludes that the evidence of record shows that the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability is shown by clear and unmistakable evidence to have not been aggravated by service.
3053|4971|1713615P62S1|1713615|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the Veteran experienced mental health problems prior to his enlistment.
3054|4972|1713615P62S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Because no psychiatric abnormality was noted at the Veteran's February 1979 enlistment examination, the Veteran benefits from a presumption of soundness.
3055|4973|1713615P62S3|1713615|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b).
3056|4976|1713615P62S4|1713615|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, the Board finds clear and unmistakable evidence sufficient to rebut the presumption of soundness.
3057|4977|1713615P63S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Although no psychiatric disability was diagnosed upon his entrance into service, the April 2011, June 2013, and November 2015 VA examiners' opinions and March 2015 private opinion all found that the available evidence showed that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability preexisted his period of service.
3058|4978|1713615P63S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds these medical opinions probative and persuasive as to the existence of a preexisting psychiatric disability in the present case.
3059|4980|1713615P64S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The January 2013 private examination report opined that the Veteran's schizoaffective disorder began during service, the result of a predisposition to the condition.
3060|4981|1713615P64S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the subsequent medical opinions, including the March 2015 private opinion submitted on behalf of the Veteran, disputed the January 2013 private examiners' finding.
3061|4982|1713615P64S3|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|As noted above, the June 2013 VA examination report convincingly addressed the weaknesses in the January 2013 report's opinions with regard to the existence of a preexisting psychiatric disorder.
3062|4983|1713615P65S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The March 2015 private opinion does not agree with the extent or character of the preexisting psychiatric conditions identified by VA examiners in the April 2011 and June 2013 reports, but does not adequately refute their findings.
3063|4984|1713615P65S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|With regard to the June 2013 opinion that polysubstance abuse was shown prior to service, the March 2015 examiner noted that this is not a proper DSM-IV diagnosis, but went on to confirm the fact that the Veteran admitted use an abuse of several drugs prior to service.
3064|4985|1713615P65S3|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|When disputing the June 2013 examination report's conclusion that the Veteran had a learning disability, the March 2015 report stated that the Veteran denied having received special education services during his interview, and could read psychological inventories presented, but did not address evidence in the record showing that the Veteran repeated at least one grade and was in a special class.
3065|4987|1713615P65S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|"Notwithstanding any disagreement with medical opinions finding preexisting psychological disabilities, the June 2015 examiner concluded that the evidence makes it ""clearly evident"" that Veteran had preexisting psychiatric ""problems"" prior to enlistment."
3066|4988|1713615P66S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|As outlined above, the record contains contradictory medical evidence regarding the existence and progression of the Veteran's psychiatric disability before and during military service.
3067|4989|1713615P66S2|1713615|False|LegalRuleSentence|It is the responsibility of the Board to assess the credibility and weight to be given to evidence.

3069|4991|1713615P67S1|1713615|False|LegalRuleSentence|The probative value of medical opinion evidence is based on the medical expert's examination of the patient, his or her knowledge and skill in analyzing the data, and his or her medical conclusion.
3070|4992|1713615P67S2|1713615|False|LegalRuleSentence|As is true with any piece of evidence, the credibility and weight to be attached to opinions are within the province of the adjudicator.

3074|4996|1713615P67S6|1713615|False|LegalRuleSentence|Other factors for assessing the probative value of a medical opinion are the examiner's access to the evidentiary record and the thoroughness and detail of the opinion.

3076|4998|1713615P68S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|At present, the Board must assign the November 2015 VA psychiatric opinion determinative probative weight.
3077|4999|1713615P68S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The VA examiners, who are considered experts in their field, gave an opinion that is clear and unequivocal, and is based on the pertinent evidence of record, including the available relevant pre-service, in-service and post-service information.
3078|5000|1713615P68S3|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The November 2015 opinion provides probative evidence, as it was predicated upon a thorough, accurate review of the record, and is supported by a sufficient rationale.
3079|5001|1713615P68S4|1713615|False|CitationSentence|Prejean, 13 Vet. App. 444; Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008) (probative value of medical opinion comes from its reasoning).
3080|5002|1713615P69S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the November 2015 VA examiners' opinion to be more persuasive than the March 2015 private opinion, because the March 2015 opinion, though clear and unequivocal in its conclusions, did not adequately support its conclusions by addressing the pertinent evidence of record.
3081|5003|1713615P69S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Instead, it omitted or failed to discuss fully the significance of evidence of psychiatric symptomatology prior to service, to include auditory hallucinations, a suicide attempt, polysubstance abuse and dependence, and abuse by the Veteran's stepfather.
3082|5004|1713615P69S3|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Rather, the March 2015 report focused on selective pieces of the evidentiary record in forming opinions about the likely psychological picture of the Veteran prior to, during, and after service.
3083|5007|1713615P69S4|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, the March 2015 report relied on the Veteran's account of not reporting hallucinations during service for fear of being discharged, but did not address his failure to report those psychiatric symptoms upon examination for discharge.
3084|5008|1713615P69S5|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|By contrast, the November 2015 report discussed and weighed the accounts in light of the evidence of record.
3085|5010|1713615P70S1|1713615|False|EvidenceSentence|The record shows that the first treatment for psychiatric complaints after service occurred in 1988.
3086|5011|1713615P70S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The March 2015 report does not address the significance of the fact that the Veteran first reported and sought treatment for psychiatric symptoms nearly eight years after his discharge from service.
3087|5012|1713615P70S3|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|"This is a significant period of time following the Veteran's discharge, given the March 2015 private examiner's opinion that the Veteran's ""psychotic symptoms were greatly exacerbated during his time in military service."""
3088|5013|1713615P70S4|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Without a discussion of this extended period of time immediately following service, where the Veteran neither sought nor received psychiatric treatment, the Board views the March 2015 examiner's conclusions of significant exacerbation of symptomatology during service as unsupportable by the evidence.
3089|5014|1713615P70S5|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|"Furthermore, the Board finds that the March 2015 psychiatric evaluation report offered conclusory and speculative opinions, such as, ""it is incomprehensible that an individual who had these preexisting conditions would not have experienced an exacerbation of his symptoms by his time in the military service,"" citing the examiner's own experience in basic training, rather than providing specific evidence of exacerbation of the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric symptomatology."
3090|5015|1713615P70S6|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The examiner neither adequately identified nor qualified the severity of the preexisting psychiatric condition(s), nor specified the degree to which it might have been exacerbated.
3091|5016|1713615P70S7|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, Board finds the March 2015 private psychological test report does not provide a well-reasoned analysis of the facts presented in the record sufficient to support its conclusions.

3093|5018|1713615P71S1|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|By contrast, the November 2015 VA opinion, which provided an addendum to the June 2013 report prepared by the same VA examiners, addresses the salient factual evidence at issue in the Veteran's appeal, specifically addressing the question of what, if any, psychiatric disabilities preexisted service, and whether the record shows by clear and unmistakable evidence that those preexisting psychiatric disabilities were not aggravated by service.
3094|5019|1713615P71S2|1713615|False|ReasoningSentence|The November 2015 VA opinion supports its conclusions with a well-reasoned analysis of the evidence, to include discussion of the weaknesses of contrary opinions and discussion of the evidence that would have supported a finding that the Veteran's preexisting psychiatric disability had been aggravated during service.
3095|5022|1713615P72S1|1713615|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that the evidence is clear and unmistakable that the Veteran's preexisting acquired psychiatric disability was not aggravated by his time in service, and therefore, service connection, must be denied.

3199|5167|1613894P55S1|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|In addition, the service records do not corroborate the Veteran's account of the stressor incident, and the record does not contain contemporaneous evidence from sources other than the service records.
3200|5169|1613894P55S2|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran has indicated that he did not file a report of personal trauma during service.
3201|5172|1613894P55S3|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|He was provided an opportunity to submit or advise VA of the potential sources of evidence contemplated in 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f)(5), but he did not provide any additional information or evidence in this regard.
3202|5174|1613894P56S1|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|As to the potentially supporting in-service evidence, there is a notation in the Veteran's service personnel record that the Veteran was absent without official leave (AWOL) for three days in November of 1962.
3203|5176|1613894P56S2|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's DD-214 also contains a notation that the Veteran had 3 days lost in November of 1962.
3204|5177|1613894P56S3|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|However, there is no indication that the Veteran went AWOL as a result of the asserted personal assault that could have happened 5 months prior, depending on what identified timeframe is relied on as the date of the assault.
3205|5179|1613894P57S1|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the record also shows that the Veteran left the Special Forces.
3206|5181|1613894P57S2|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's wife has indicated that this occurred because of the physical assault.

3208|5184|1613894P57S4|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran told the May 2012 VA examiner that he was getting increasingly scared about parachuting and did not enjoy it.
3209|5186|1613894P57S5|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|He also stated that he hurt his ankle twice while in jump school and did not want to continue.
3210|5187|1613894P58S1|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|On review of the medical records, the Board finds that the May 2012 VA examination is the most probative medical evidence of record, as to the question of whether the Veteran's claimed personal assault stressor actually occurred.
3211|5189|1613894P58S2|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner opined that there is no evidence in his military record of markers related to MST.
3212|5191|1613894P58S3|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that the Veteran sought treatment for a sprained ankle twice, sore throat, and cough consistently between 1961-1964 with no apparent increase in medical services after the asserted assault in 1962.
3213|5194|1613894P58S4|1613894|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner further stated that the Veteran reports a history of alcohol problems beginning prior to the assault with no significant change in pattern after 1962.
3214|5195|1613894P58S5|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board affords substantial probative weight to this opinion, as it is based on review of the claims file, to include the Veteran's contentions and the medical evidence of record, an accurate characterization of the evidence of record, and supporting rationale.

3216|5197|1613894P59S1|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|Although there are VA treatment records that show assessments of PTSD based on in-service personal assault, these determinations were made based on the Veteran's current reports of these events, which the Board has found not credible.
3217|5198|1613894P59S2|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, these opinions are of limited probative value on this question.

3219|5202|1613894P60S1|1613894|False|FindingSentence|Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the record does not contain credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service personal assault stressor occurred.
3220|5204|1613894P60S2|1613894|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the claim does not satisfy this element necessary for service connection, and no discussion of the remaining elements is necessary.
3221|5205|1613894P60S3|1613894|False|CitationSentence|See Arzio v. Shinseki, 602 F.3d 1343, 1346 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) makes clear that credible evidence of an in-service stressor is a mandatory or compulsory element in any claim for disability compensation for PTSD).

3224|5211|1613894P61S3|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, these claims do not satisfy this element necessary for service connection for PTSD, and no discussion of the remaining elements is necessary.

3230|5220|1613894P63S3|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the Board cannot limit its analysis of the Veteran's claim solely to PTSD.
3231|5221|1613894P63S4|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, his claim potentially encompasses psychiatric conditions other than PTSD that are reasonably raised by the record.

3233|5224|1613894P64S1|1613894|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.

3248|5248|1613894P66S10|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, it cannot be said that the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the Veteran had a preexisting psychiatric disorder.
3249|5249|1613894P66S11|1613894|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, the Board's analysis must turn to the issue of whether a current psychiatric disorder was incurred during the Veteran's active service.

3318|5345|1721981P38S8|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|In response, the Veteran underwent psychological evaluation.
3319|5347|1721981P38S9|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|In a May 1972 report, the evaluating psychologist indicated that no psychiatric disability or symptoms were found.
3320|5351|1721981P38S10|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the April 1972 discharge report of medical examination notes the Veteran's psychiatric state as normal, while a June 1972 medical evaluation board report addressing orthopedic disability is negative for psychiatric disability, as is a June 1972 physical evaluation board (PEB) report.
3321|5353|1721981P39S1|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|With regard to the issue of presumptive service connection under 38 C.F.R. § 3.309(a), the record contains no medical evidence dated between August 1972 and August 1973 - within the first year of discharge from service - indicating chronic psychiatric disability.

3324|5360|1721981P39S4|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|Indeed, the earliest post-service evidence of an acquired psychiatric disability is found in a September 1990 private psychiatry report, which notes diagnoses of schizophrenia and PTSD.
3325|5362|1721981P39S5|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|This report is dated over 18 years after discharge from active duty.

3327|5364|1721981P40S1|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, no evidence dated between August 1972 and September 1990 indicates that the Veteran then had chronic psychiatric disability.
3328|5365|1721981P40S2|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|Notwithstanding his claim to service connection related to combat conditions in Vietnam in the early 1970s, the record does not document the existence of chronic psychiatric disability during service, within the first year of separation from service, or for multiple years following service.
3329|5366|1721981P40S3|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|The preponderance of the evidence indicates that, for years following service, the Veteran did not have characteristic manifestations sufficient to identify a chronic disease entity.

3331|5368|1721981P41S1|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|The medical nexus evidence also indicates that acquired psychiatric disability is not related to service.
3332|5370|1721981P41S2|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|In the only medical opinion of record to comment on the issue of medical nexus, the December 2012 VA examiner found the in-service stressors unrelated to current psychiatric problems.
3333|5372|1721981P41S3|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner diagnosed psychosis, with hallucinations due to alcohol abuse.
3334|5374|1721981P41S4|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner found that the Veteran did not have PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder in addition to psychosis.
3335|5376|1721981P41S5|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|And the examiner found the psychosis likely unrelated to service.
3336|5379|1721981P41S6|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|This examiner indicated a review of the claims file, and noted that an interview of the Veteran and a personal examination of the Veteran were both conducted.
3337|5381|1721981P41S7|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|In the report, the examiner also detailed the Veteran's medical history of psychiatric issues.
3338|5384|1721981P41S8|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the examiner reiterated her opinion in an October 2014 addendum opinion, which was requested by the Board in the July 2014 remand.
3339|5385|1721981P41S9|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|As the opinion is based on the evidence of record detailed earlier, and is explained, the opinion is of probative value.

3342|5390|1721981P42S2|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|These reports and records note acquired psychiatric disability such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, schizophrenia, and alcohol induced psychosis.
3343|5392|1721981P42S3|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|None the reports and records, other than the December 2012 VA report and October 2014 addendum report, provides a medical opinion addressing the issue of medical nexus.
3344|5394|1721981P42S4|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the PTSD diagnosis is only noted in private reports dated in September 1990 and July 2005.
3345|5396|1721981P42S5|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|These reports do not provide a rationale explaining the basis for providing such a diagnosis.
3346|5398|1721981P42S6|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|The reports merely note the Veteran's adverse symptoms, his experiences, and the diagnosis without any explanation.
3347|5399|1721981P42S7|1721981|False|CitationSentence|See Bloom, supra.
3348|5401|1721981P42S8|1721981|False|EvidenceSentence|Importantly, none of the examining or treating VA medical personnel diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD.
3349|5403|1721981P42S9|1721981|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the evidence is not sufficient to find that the Veteran has PTSD related to his experiences in Vietnam.
3350|5404|1721981P42S10|1721981|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
3351|5405|1721981P43S1|1721981|False|Sentence|In assessing this claim, the Board has considered the Veteran's complaints of psychiatric difficulty.
3352|5406|1721981P43S2|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|He is competent to report observable symptoms such as mental anguish and limitation.

3354|5408|1721981P43S4|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|However, on the issues of diagnosis and etiology, the medical evidence is more credible.
3355|5409|1721981P43S5|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|The development of a psychiatric problem is an internal pathology beyond the Veteran's capacity to observe.
3356|5410|1721981P43S6|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|It is a complex question of etiology which requires the determination of a medical professional.

3358|5412|1721981P43S8|1721981|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, the lay evidence on this question is medically insignificant when compared with the findings by the neutral and informed December 2012 VA examiner.
3359|5415|1721981P43S9|1721981|False|FindingSentence|In weighing the evidence, the Board finds that the medical evidence of record, and the lack thereof, preponderates against the Veteran's claim regarding diagnosis and etiology.

3361|5419|1721981P44S1|1721981|False|FindingSentence|As the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim to service connection for a psychiatric disability, the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine does not apply, and the claim must be denied.

3372|5434|1731026P21S1|1731026|False|Sentence|The Board acknowledges that the Veteran receives Social Security disability benefits and that there are no Social Security Administration (SSA) medical records associated with the claims file.
3373|5436|1731026P21S2|1731026|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran has indicated that he receives these benefits and ceased working due to a nonservice-connected back injury that resulted from a traffic accident.
3374|5437|1731026P21S3|1731026|False|LegalRuleSentence|VA is required to obtain relevant SSA records which are (1) those records that relate to the injury for which the appellant is seeking benefits, and (2) have a reasonable possibility of helping to substantiate the claim.

3376|5439|1731026P21S5|1731026|False|Sentence|As the Veteran's SSA records pertain to an unrelated injury and do not have a reasonable possibility of helping to substantiate his PTSD or dysthymia claim, it is not necessary to obtain these records.
3377|5440|1731026P22S1|1731026|False|Sentence|Neither the Veteran nor his representative has raised any other issues with the duty to notify or duty to assist.

3379|5443|1731026P23S1|1731026|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that his currently-diagnosed PTSD was caused by incidents in service, namely that he feared being deployed to the Republic of Vietnam during wartime, he heard about and saw pictures of many people being killed in service there, and that he observed a fight while stationed in Germany that resulted in one man stabbing and killing another.
3380|5444|1731026P24S1|1731026|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.
3381|5445|1731026P24S2|1731026|False|LegalRuleSentence|This means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.

3569|5725|1633713P29S8|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|He asserts that his continuing symptoms are related to the death of his brother during service.

3571|5729|1633713P30S2|1633713|False|LegalRuleSentence|Establishing service connection generally requires medical or, in certain circumstances, lay evidence of (1) a current disability; (2) an in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a nexus between the claimed in-service disease or injury and the present disability.

3575|5733|1633713P32S1|1633713|False|LegalRuleSentence|A diagnosis of PTSD must be established in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a), which mandates that, for VA purposes, all mental disorder diagnoses must conform to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM).

3579|5739|1633713P33S1|1633713|False|FindingSentence|As an initial matter, the Board notes that the presumption of soundness applies in this matter.
3580|5740|1633713P33S2|1633713|False|LegalRuleSentence|A veteran will be considered to have been in sound condition when examined and accepted for service, except as to disorders noted on entrance into service, or when clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that the disability existed prior to service and was not aggravated by service.

3582|5742|1633713P33S4|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Although there is evidence of record that the Veteran experienced some psychiatric symptoms prior to service, his May 1974 entrance examination revealed no psychiatric disorder.
3583|5743|1633713P33S5|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Additionally, even though an October 2010 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's PTSD and depression had their onset prior to service, the January 2013 VA examiner opined that it was not undebatable that the Veteran's PTSD and depression pre-existed service.
3584|5746|1633713P33S6|1633713|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds that presumption of soundness applies in this matter and has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence.
3585|5747|1633713P33S7|1633713|False|Sentence|The issue in this case is whether the Veteran's PTSD and/or depression had an onset in service or is due to an event occurring in service.
3586|5750|1633713P34S1|1633713|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that service connection for PTSD is warranted because the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD linked to the death of his brother during service.
3587|5751|1633713P34S2|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no dispute that the Veteran's brother died in October 1974, while the Veteran was serving on active duty.
3588|5752|1633713P34S3|1633713|False|Sentence|The issue for adjudication is whether he has a diagnosis of PTSD that is linked to his brother's death.
3589|5755|1633713P34S4|1633713|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise.
3590|5758|1633713P34S5|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran submitted private medical opinions in September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 in which clinical psychologist J. Smith opined that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and that the diagnosis of PTSD is linked to the death of his brother.
3591|5759|1633713P34S6|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See September 2012, February 2013 and April 2014 Private Medical Opinions of J. Smith, Ph.D.
3592|5761|1633713P34S7|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's VA medical records also show a diagnosis of PTSD during the appeal period.
3593|5763|1633713P34S8|1633713|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds this evidence sufficient to establish a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with the applicable regulations.
3594|5764|1633713P34S9|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See Cohen v. Brown, 10 Vet. App. 128, 140 (1997).
3595|5767|1633713P35S1|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board notes that the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners both opined that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under either the DSM IV or the DSM 5 because his stressor fails to meet Criterion A necessary for PTSD diagnosis.
3596|5770|1633713P35S2|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2013 VA examiner also opined that the Veteran denied current significant re-experiencing (Criterion B) symptoms and further denied significant avoidance and impairment in functioning symptoms regarding his reported stressor.
3597|5772|1633713P35S3|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in his April 2014 addendum opinion, Dr. Smith addressed these criteria, stating that the death of the Veteran's brother did meet Criterion A because the Veteran was confronted with the death of his brother and his response to this news was one of horror and helplessness.
3598|5774|1633713P35S4|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|"Dr. Smith further noted that the diagnosis of PTSD reflects continuing symptoms of poor sleep, marked and continuing anxiety and depression, continued intrusion of ""triggering"" experiences and events such as contact with his family or hearing reports on the news of young people dying in a hit and run situation, and avoidance of the area of where his brother died."
3599|5777|1633713P35S5|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|"The October 2010 VA examiner also noted that the Veteran reported experiencing intrusive thoughts related to his brother on a weekly basis, and avoidance of therapy because the he ""doesn't like to bring up the past."""
3600|5780|1633713P35S6|1633713|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise on the issue of whether the Veteran has a diagnosis of PTSD relating to his brother's death.
3601|5781|1633713P35S7|1633713|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 5107(b).
3602|5783|1633713P35S8|1633713|False|FindingSentence|Consequently, service connection for PTSD is warranted.

3604|5787|1633713P36S1|1633713|False|FindingSentence|The Board also finds that the evidence of record is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran's depression is related to the death of his younger brother.
3605|5789|1633713P36S2|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported experiencing psychiatric symptoms, including depression, social isolation and nightmares, in service and since his discharge from service.

3608|5794|1633713P36S5|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also reported attempting suicide within one year after his separation from service, and attempting suicide multiple times before seeking treatment in 1984.
3609|5795|1633713P36S6|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran is competent to offer testimony regarding the symptoms he experienced.
3610|5796|1633713P36S7|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994).
3611|5797|1633713P37S1|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board observes that there is evidence of record that contradicts the Veteran's assertion that his symptoms started in service and have been recurrent since that time.
3612|5799|1633713P37S2|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|Most notably, he was examined multiple times in service and found to have no psychiatric disorder.
3613|5800|1633713P37S3|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See February 1975 Report of Mental Status Evaluation; see also May 1975 Mental Hygiene Consultation Report.
3614|5802|1633713P37S4|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran reported that his psychiatric examination was very brief.
3615|5805|1633713P37S5|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|"Additionally, Dr. Smith opined that the examination ""appeared to be simply designed to meet an administrative requirement and did not constitute a full psychiatric examination"" because the examination report showed no evidence that the examiner explored the Veteran's reaction to his brother's death."
3616|5806|1633713P37S6|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See April 2014 Addendum Private Medical Opinion of J. Smith.
3617|5807|1633713P37S7|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the Board does not find the lack of a psychiatric diagnosis on examination during service to be determinative.
3618|5808|1633713P38S1|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|After weighing the evidence and affording the Veteran the benefit of all reasonable doubt, the Board finds his reports regarding the onset and continuation of his depressive symptoms to be credible.
3619|5809|1633713P38S2|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|As noted by the March 2016, the Veteran's reports of ongoing psychiatric symptoms have been consistent.
3620|5811|1633713P38S3|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|In August 1989, when discussing the history of his depression, he stated that his brother's death had been very traumatic for him.

3622|5814|1633713P38S5|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|"At a February 2006 group therapy session, he talked about how his brother's death was ""still bothering him."""
3623|5815|1633713P38S6|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See February 2006 VA Medical Record.
3624|5817|1633713P38S7|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|During an April 2006 examination performed in connection with his Social Security disability claim, he stated that he thought his psychological symptoms were due, at least in part, to the death of his brother.
3625|5818|1633713P38S8|1633713|False|CitationSentence|See April 2006 Psychological Examination Report.
3626|5822|1633713P38S9|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Board notes that he reported having ""problems"" beginning in 1984, but that during the same time frame he also reported first seeking treatment in 1984 and first experiencing an impact in his ability to work in 1984."
3627|5823|1633713P38S10|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, it appears that he did not mean that his symptoms started at that time, but that he became significantly impaired in 1984.
3628|5825|1633713P38S11|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|At his October 2007 hearing, he again reported having an onset of depressive symptoms in service.

3631|5830|1633713P38S14|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|He also reported that he attempted suicide in the early 1970s after service, and that his suicide attempts have been primarily by overdose, carbon monoxide poisoning and a few times by placing a gun to his head without pulling the trigger.
3632|5831|1633713P38S15|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|This report is consistent with his statements made during his interview with Dr. Smith (as reported in the September 2012 independent evaluation report), the statements captured in his February 2013 affidavit, and the statements made during the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examinations.
3633|5832|1633713P38S16|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|In light of the consistencies in the Veteran's reports concerning the onset and continuity of his symptoms, the Board finds his testimony credible.
3634|5833|1633713P39S1|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Because the Board finds the Veteran's reports of his recurrent psychiatric symptoms to be credible, it affords more probative value to the opinions of the Dr. Smith, and less probative value to the opinions of the VA examiners.
3635|5835|1633713P39S2|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners opined that the Veteran's depression was not related to his brother's death because there were no contemporaneous medical records confirming his reports of depressive symptoms prior to 1984.
3636|5837|1633713P39S3|1633713|False|EvidenceSentence|The November 2013 VA examiner also reasoned that there were no mention of mental health issues in the letters the Veteran submitted from friends and family in support of his discharge from service.

3641|5842|1633713P39S8|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|Additionally, there is no reason for the Board to determine that there would be reports of psychiatric symptoms contained in the letters provided by the Veteran's friends and family in support of his request for discharge from service based on his religious beliefs.
3642|5843|1633713P39S9|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|The evidence of record shows that the purpose of those letters was to corroborate the Veteran's assertion that his change in religious viewed prevented him from serving on active duty; consequently, it is not expected that any discussion of depressive symptoms would be included in such letters.
3643|5844|1633713P39S10|1633713|False|ReasoningSentence|For these reasons, the Board affords the November 2013 and March 2016 VA examiners' negative nexus opinions little probative value.

3648|5853|1343153P22S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|3. The presumption of soundness does not apply as it is not shown that the Veteran's PTSD manifested during her service.
3649|5855|1343153P23S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|4. The Veteran is currently diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
3650|5857|1343153P23S2|1343153|False|FindingSentence|5. In-service stressors, sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, have been verified.
3651|5860|1343153P24S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|6. The Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service, and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.
3652|5861|1343153P27S1|1343153|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
3653|5863|1343153P41S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the Veteran contends that she currently experiences symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares and flashbacks of various events that she photographed and from pictures that she processed while working as a still photographer in service.
3654|5865|1343153P41S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|As such, she believes that her current psychiatric problems are related to her military service.
3655|5868|1343153P41S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also asserted that she was placed on medical hold shortly after she entered service, and testified that not knowing whether she would be able to continue her military service caused her a great deal of stress.
3656|5869|1343153P42S1|1343153|False|Sentence|Initially, the Board must determine whether the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1111, 1132 applies in this case.
3657|5871|1343153P42S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"The relevant evidence on this question includes a February 2007 VA examination report where the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran suffered PTSD in her youth and that this was ""possibly aggravated"" by service."
3658|5875|1343153P42S3|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Although this evidence suggests that an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, pre-existed entrance into service, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that an acquired psychiatric disability existed prior to service as required under 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1111, 1132.
3659|5877|1343153P43S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran was found to be psychiatrically normal at a November 1984 physical examination prior to entrance into service.
3660|5880|1343153P43S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, although the Veteran has acknowledged that she had a childhood history of abuse, she has also stated that she did not have psychiatric problems upon entry into service.
3661|5882|1343153P43S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|On a medical history survey completed in conjunction with her enlistment physical, the Veteran denied any history of nervous trouble, frequent trouble sleeping, or depression.
3662|5885|1343153P43S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, in the most recent June 2013 VA examination report, conducted pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the VA examiner acknowledged that there was no pre-service medical documentation suggesting that the Veteran's PTSD had its onset prior to service, and thus concluded that the Veteran's PTSD did not pre-exist service.
3663|5886|1343153P44S1|1343153|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, as noted, the presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.
3664|5887|1343153P44S2|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 54 (2012).
3665|5888|1343153P44S3|1343153|False|Sentence|The Court has cautioned that the presumption of soundness is not a sword for a veteran to fulfill the second element of service connection without any evidence of the manifestation of an in-service disability.

3667|5890|1343153P44S5|1343153|False|LegalRuleSentence|Otherwise stated, before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service.
3668|5891|1343153P44S6|1343153|False|CitationSentence|"See Holton v. Shinseki, 557 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2012) (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service."")."
3669|5893|1343153P45S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD manifested during service.
3670|5896|1343153P45S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|As the examiner in June 2013 explained, the service treatment records did not show the diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.
3671|5898|1343153P45S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran was referred for a mental health consultation in June 1990 to evaluate the Veteran's extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.
3672|5900|1343153P45S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically in June 1990, just two months before separation, the Veteran was evaluated by the chief of the mental health clinic.
3673|5902|1343153P45S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, no Axis I psychiatric disability was diagnosed following that evaluation.
3674|5904|1343153P45S6|1343153|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had an Axis I psychiatric disability during service.
3675|5905|1343153P46S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that the Veteran has alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of a psychiatric disability.
3676|5906|1343153P46S2|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
3677|5909|1343153P46S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the medical officer evaluated the Veteran during service, but found that her reported symptoms did not warrant the diagnosis of an Axis I psychiatric disability.
3678|5910|1343153P47S1|1343153|False|LegalRuleSentence|As was explained, absent the predicate finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
3679|5911|1343153P47S2|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert, supra.
3680|5912|1343153P47S3|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability onset or was present during service.
3681|5913|1343153P47S4|1343153|False|Sentence|In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.
3682|5914|1343153P47S5|1343153|False|Sentence|However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.
3683|5917|1343153P47S6|1343153|False|FindingSentence|As such, even though the Veteran has since service identified several in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of any Axis I psychiatric disability.
3684|5919|1343153P47S7|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
3685|5920|1343153P48S1|1343153|False|Sentence|The analysis does not stop here, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD was either caused or aggravated by her military service.
3686|5923|1343153P49S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|The occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are adequately verified in the record, as her personnel records reflect that she photographically documented an aircraft accident, and a statement from a fellow service photographer, corroborates that she was responsible for documenting plane crashes, child abuse incidents, and spousal abuse incidents, as well as an occasion when a flight-line airman was killed when a landing gear tire exploded.
3687|5925|1343153P49S2|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran had these experiences during service.
3688|5927|1343153P49S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
3689|5928|1343153P50S1|1343153|False|Sentence|However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.
3690|5929|1343153P51S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD.
3691|5932|1343153P51S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran has pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service as evidence of the onset of an acquired psychiatric disability, the medical evidence of record from service does not actually show that any psychiatric disorder was ever diagnosed despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.
3692|5936|1343153P51S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The record shows that the Veteran was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985; however, the mental status examination was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.
3693|5940|1343153P51S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that the Veteran's records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems, and that she was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.
3694|5942|1343153P51S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints, abnormalities or diagnosis for any psychiatric problems during service.
3695|5944|1343153P51S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding the June 1990 entry, the service records show that the Veteran was seen by psychiatric services for stress.
3696|5947|1343153P51S7|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|No specific findings were reported and no Axis I diagnosis was found to be warranted.
3697|5949|1343153P52S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, service records reveal that the Veteran was AWOL on the day that she was seen at the mental health clinic in June 1990, and subsequently received nonjudicial punishment (Article 15) for her actions, which included punching a hole in a wall.
3698|5951|1343153P52S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The records show that the Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.
3699|5953|1343153P53S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).
3700|5955|1343153P53S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.
3701|5958|1343153P53S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.
3702|5960|1343153P54S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.
3703|5962|1343153P54S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.
3704|5964|1343153P54S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She was counseled numerous times on the condition of her dormitory room, her personal hygiene and the condition of her uniform with little or no improvement.
3705|5966|1343153P54S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She had angry outbursts at work and in the dormitory which alienated the Veteran from her peers, and despite financial counseling regarding several overdue accounts at various local businesses, she continue to spend to excess.
3706|5969|1343153P54S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to sergeant in October 1989, but was subsequently recommended and promoted to E-5 in February 1990.
3707|5971|1343153P54S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in July 1990, the Veteran's commanding officer recommended that the Veteran's appointment (promotion) be vacated.
3708|5973|1343153P55S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have aver the previous six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military service.
3709|5976|1343153P56S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|On a Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.
3710|5978|1343153P57S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|As described, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's PTSD was diagnosed either during her military service or for many years thereafter.
3711|5981|1343153P57S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran even acknowledged in her testimony that she did not have any psychiatric problems during service and she denied seeking any psychiatric treatment or reporting any psychiatric problems during her service, including at the time of discharge from service.
3712|5983|1343153P57S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, no psychiatric disorder was diagnosed at the time of discharge from service.
3713|5984|1343153P57S4|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|These pieces of evidence weigh heavily against a finding that the Veteran's later diagnosed PTSD was incurred in or is otherwise related to her military service.
3714|5986|1343153P58S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, in the June 2013 VA examination report, the examiner found that while the Veteran did have a repeated pattern of misconduct during service, it was a result of her personality disorder, and not PTSD.
3715|5987|1343153P58S2|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative as the examiner conducted an in-depth review of the claims file, and provided a detailed rationale for all opinions rendered.
3716|5988|1343153P58S3|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See Prejean, 13 Vet. App. at 448-9.
3717|5990|1343153P58S4|1343153|False|FindingSentence|For these reasons, the Board finds that PTSD was not incurred in service and was not evidenced by the numerous outbursts and problems in service.
3718|5991|1343153P59S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|Also weighing against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events are the post-service treatment records.
3719|5994|1343153P59S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"Review of the VBMS record reveals that the Veteran first initiated contact with a mental health professional in June 2002 at which time the Veteran related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle consisting of bondage and sadomasochism."""
3720|5996|1343153P59S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She also went into detail about abuse suffered as a child.
3721|5998|1343153P59S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005 when she was psychiatrically hospitalized at the Tucson VA due to depression with suicidal ideation including a plan to jump off a bridge or walk into the desert and never return.
3722|6000|1343153P59S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily due to the Veteran's ex-wife.
3723|6002|1343153P60S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported nightmares about children being beaten and her father harming her sister.
3724|6004|1343153P60S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She also reported the death of her fiancé in 1997 as very upsetting.
3725|6006|1343153P60S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She did mention in-service photos of women and children who were beaten, raped, and included a 4-year-old boy with bloody electrical cord marks across his back and chest.
3726|6008|1343153P60S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, dreams, and anger.
3727|6010|1343153P60S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequently, in December 2006, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymic disorder.
3728|6012|1343153P60S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which was predominantly related to childhood abuse.
3729|6014|1343153P61S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in February 2007 to assist in determining the nature and etiology of her psychiatric disorders.
3730|6016|1343153P61S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed PTSD from childhood abuse, possibly aggravated by military service.
3731|6017|1343153P61S3|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|"However, the use of ""possibly"" renders the opinion too equivocal to provide the requisite nexus."
3732|6018|1343153P61S4|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993).
3733|6020|1343153P61S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in June 2013 to investigate whether the verified in-service stressors caused or aggravated her currently diagnosed PTSD.
3734|6022|1343153P61S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.
3735|6024|1343153P61S7|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, she found that that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular syndrome of PTSD.
3736|6028|1343153P62S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.
3737|6031|1343153P62S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.
3738|6033|1343153P62S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the majority of treatment notes in the electronic medical record pertain to the Veteran's childhood abuse.
3739|6035|1343153P62S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancé died.
3740|6037|1343153P62S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In recent treatment, she cited this as the most traumatic event experienced.
3741|6039|1343153P62S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.
3742|6041|1343153P63S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"Notably, the examiner explained that the Veteran had not met Criteria ""B"" under the DSM-IV PTSD criteria (i.e., symptoms of reexperiencing) because her symptoms were predominately related to childhood traumas."
3743|6043|1343153P63S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"Similarly, the record did not reflect documentation of symptoms supporting Criteria ""C"" and ""D"" under the DSM-IV (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) which were relatable to the Veteran's in-service stressor events."
3744|6045|1343153P63S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Based on these reasons, the June 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's childhood abuse and her fiancée's death in 1997, and not the in-service events, were the contributing stressors to the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis.
3745|6047|1343153P63S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner further opined that currently diagnosed PTSD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service stressors.
3746|6048|1343153P63S5|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.
3747|6050|1343153P64S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board also requested the examiner to consider whether the Veteran's repeated misconduct during service was indicative of the onset of her PTSD.
3748|6054|1343153P64S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service, but suggested that it was a result of her previously diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her diagnosis of PTSD.
3749|6058|1343153P64S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any psychiatric disorder having been diagnosed or any mention of symptoms of anxiety or depression as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.
3750|6060|1343153P64S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties were occurring as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.
3751|6061|1343153P65S1|1343153|False|Sentence|In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.
3752|6062|1343153P65S2|1343153|False|Sentence|"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem, or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors."
3753|6063|1343153P66S1|1343153|False|Sentence|The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors, and suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service, and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have brought the childhood traumas back up for the Veteran, and even now be hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.
3754|6064|1343153P67S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has considered this argument, and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.
3755|6065|1343153P67S2|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, if the portion of the examination report cited by the representative were to be read in isolation, it might appear to leave open the possibility that the Veteran's PTSD could have been aggravated by her in-service experiences.
3756|6066|1343153P67S3|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|However, when the opinion is read in its entirety, the VA examiner's opinion is very clear that she does not believe that the Veteran's corroborated in-service stressors caused or aggravated her PTSD.
3757|6069|1343153P68S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"Although the examiner found that the witnessing of a traumatic event, such as the ones experienced by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criteria ""A"" under the DSM-IV for PTSD, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criteria B, C, or D under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences."
3758|6071|1343153P68S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and not with the Veteran's experiences in service.
3759|6072|1343153P68S3|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|"Moreover, although the representative has suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors."
3760|6073|1343153P69S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her currently diagnosed PTSD to her verified in-service stressor event.
3761|6074|1343153P69S2|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other lay and medical evidence of record.
3762|6075|1343153P69S3|1343153|False|LegalRuleSentence|Credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias or inconsistent statements; and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony are also factors that may be considered.

3766|6079|1343153P70S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.
3767|6081|1343153P70S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.
3768|6084|1343153P70S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported first realizing that there was something wrong in approximately 2002, and that after doing some research, she realized that she had all the symptoms described for PTSD, including hypervigilance and panic attacks.
3769|6086|1343153P70S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.
3770|6088|1343153P70S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.
3771|6091|1343153P71S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service several times a week, she never described or reported any such symptoms related to service to any healthcare provider at anytime during the pendency of this appeal, including when examined by VA in 2007.
3772|6093|1343153P71S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks."
3773|6095|1343153P71S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered as a child and of witnessing the rape of her sister.
3774|6097|1343153P71S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|At one point, she reported having vivid flashbacks of parts of an incident in which she was raped while living with her father, and said that she had them over and over, daily.

3776|6100|1343153P71S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|However, on other occasions, she reported that she could not recall whether she was ever sexually abused as a child.

3778|6103|1343153P71S8|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In any event, other than at the personal hearing, the Veteran never described any nightmares or flashbacks related to her service experiences at anytime during the pendency of this appeal.
3779|6106|1343153P72S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005; as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until more than two years after she first sought psychiatric help.
3780|6107|1343153P72S2|1343153|False|CitationSentence|See July 2007 treatment note.
3781|6110|1343153P72S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Even then, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service, and said only that when she hears a child cry, it reminds her of a child she photographed in service that had been abused.
3782|6112|1343153P72S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported being physically, sexually and emotionally abused as a child and believed that this was part of her PTSD.
3783|6113|1343153P72S5|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or at least some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed was related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some five years later - and more than two years after she initially sought psychiatric treatment - is not believable or credible.
3784|6114|1343153P73S1|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.
3785|6117|1343153P73S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancée.
3786|6119|1343153P73S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, while the Veteran was treated by several other psychiatrists over the years, most of those reports indicate that her current psychiatric problems were related to her childhood abuse.
3787|6121|1343153P73S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The evidence does not demonstrate that any treating healthcare provider suggested that the Veteran's current PTSD was incurred in or caused by her experiences in service.
3788|6124|1343153P74S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Based on the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD and her corroborated in-service stressor events.
3789|6127|1343153P74S2|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, and the claim must be denied.
3790|6130|1343153P74S3|1343153|False|FindingSentence|Because the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

3793|6134|1343153P76S1|1343153|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record demonstrates that, in addition to PTSD, the Veteran has also been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders, to include major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
3794|6137|1343153P77S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted in the previous section, a psychiatric disorder was not noted at service entrance and service treatment records are negative for any diagnoses or treatment for major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
3795|6140|1343153P77S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In the Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.
3796|6143|1343153P78S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Review of the evidence of record reveals that the Veteran first initiated contact with mental health professionals in June 2002, where she related having been depressed since February 2002, 12 years after service separation.
3797|6146|1343153P78S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Importantly, the Veteran did not relate her depression to service, but instead, stated that it began when she left her wife to be involved in an alternative lifestyle.
3798|6148|1343153P78S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005 when she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily related to her ex-wife.

3803|6158|1343153P79S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequently, in December 2006, the Veteran was diagnosed dysthymic disorder.
3804|6160|1343153P79S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which was predominantly related to childhood abuse.
3805|6164|1343153P80S1|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board finds that VA treatment notes of record document an extensive and complex mental health history; however, they do not provide a medical opinion as to the etiology of the Veteran's depression.
3806|6166|1343153P80S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In efforts to obtain a medical opinion on the question of whether the Veteran's psychiatric disorders were etiologically related to service, the Veteran was afforded a VA examination in February 2007.
3807|6168|1343153P80S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner, in pertinent part, diagnosed gender identity disorder, depressive disorder (in remission), and personality disorder, with histrionic and narcissistic traits.
3808|6170|1343153P80S4|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner opined that none of these psychiatric disorders were related to service.
3809|6172|1343153P80S5|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|In support of this opinion, the February 2007 VA examiner reasoned that there was no evidence during the examination that the Veteran was suffering from depression.
3810|6175|1343153P80S6|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|According to the examiner, the suicidal note that the Veteran gave to a counselor in August of 2006 was for attention seeking behavior as the Veteran had a pattern of behavior that would be inferred as narcissistic and/or histrionic.
3811|6177|1343153P80S7|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that, since her youth, the Veteran seemed to have had a pattern of seeking attention suggesting a character or personality disorder.

3813|6181|1343153P80S9|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained that the Veteran seemed ambivalent and was not aggressively seeking the process with the proper experts to initiate these changes.
3814|6182|1343153P80S10|1343153|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the February 2007 VA medical opinion highly probative as the examiner interviewed the Veteran, reviewed the claims file, performed a mental status examination, and provided an opinion supported by a detailed rationale.

3816|6186|1343153P81S2|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|Although it was noted that the Veteran continued to meet the criteria for a personality disorder diagnosis due to a pervasive pattern of interpersonal problems, inability to conform to some social norms, and limited adaptability to stressful environments, the personality disorder was found to be rooted in severe childhood abuse, and not service.
3817|6188|1343153P81S3|1343153|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined that the psychiatric disorders were less likely than not incurred in or caused by the service.

3854|6234|1608262P35S2|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, he asserts that he suffers from PTSD as a result of seeing fellow sailors commit suicide.
3855|6237|1608262P36S1|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|STRs show that at his August 1990 intake examination, he indicated that he had depression or excessive worry.
3856|6239|1608262P36S2|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|He clarified this by reporting that he worried occasionally over situation stress.
3857|6241|1608262P36S3|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|He had a normal psychiatric examination and no psychiatric diagnosis was noted.
3858|6243|1608262P36S4|1608262|False|FindingSentence|As such, the presumption of soundness attaches to the Veteran's case.
3859|6246|1608262P37S1|1608262|False|FindingSentence|However, because, as will be discussed, the evidence shows that an anxiety disorder did not manifest in service, there is no need to discuss the presumption of soundness.
3860|6247|1608262P37S2|1608262|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 55 (2012) (holding that the presumption of soundness applies only when a disease or injury manifests in service which was not noted on entry, and a question arises as to whether it preexisted service).
3861|6248|1608262P37S3|1608262|False|LegalRuleSentence|"As the Court stated in Gilbert: ""The presumption of soundness . . . does not relieve the veteran of the obligation to show the presence of a current disability and to demonstrate a nexus between that disability and the in-service injury or disease or aggravation thereof."""

3873|6271|1608262P40S3|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|In April 2011, VA determined that the information required to corroborate the stressful events described by the Veteran was insufficient and that all procedures to obtain information from the Veteran were properly followed.

3886|6299|1608262P44S1|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was afforded a VA examination in June 2014.
3887|6301|1608262P44S2|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examination consisted of a review of the Veteran's claims file, an interview of the Veteran, and a mental status examination of the Veteran.

3893|6316|1608262P44S8|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder as he did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria for bipolar disorder or any kind.
3894|6319|1608262P44S9|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the diagnosis of bipolar contained in his medical records should be considered a misdiagnosis as the provider appeared to have not been familiar with the Veteran's treatment record.
3895|6322|1608262P44S10|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran's past diagnosis was made, in part, due to the Veteran's reporting different symptoms to different providers.
3896|6324|1608262P44S11|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of panic disorder as the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.
3897|6326|1608262P44S12|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran's reported panic attacks were likely a side-effect of substances or the discontinuation of substances.
3898|6328|1608262P44S13|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reported that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of adjustment disorder as the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria.

3902|6336|1608262P44S17|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reported that the Veteran had some mild problems with anxiety that may warrant an Axis I diagnosis.
3903|6338|1608262P44S18|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the examiner opined that the Veteran's anxiety disorder was not caused by, related to, or the result of his naval service.

3912|6358|1608262P46S1|1608262|False|FindingSentence|Based upon the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence fails to support a diagnosis of PTSD at any time during the appeal period

3916|6363|1608262P46S5|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's reported history was adequately considered.
3917|6364|1608262P46S6|1608262|False|CitationSentence|See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23 (2007).
3918|6365|1608262P46S7|1608262|False|Sentence|Without a diagnosis of PTSD, the Veteran fails to meet the requirements of service connection set out under 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
3919|6367|1608262P46S8|1608262|False|FindingSentence|Service connection for PTSD is denied.
3920|6368|1608262P47S1|1608262|False|Sentence|"The Veteran's representative argued in the February 2016 brief that the Veteran was unaware of terminology, and simply did not understand ""anxiety"" and ""depression"" at the age of 18 and 19."
3921|6371|1608262P47S2|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|"In a Report of Medical History, dated August 2, 1990, the Veteran marked ""Yes"" for depression; the doctor's explanation was ""situational stress."
3922|6376|1608262P47S3|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|"The representative noted that on a Medical Questionnaire for Potential Respirator Users, he reported that he had a ""sensation of smothering"" and that it was ""hard to breath over certain period (sic) of time""; and that on Sept 10, 1991, the Veteran had reported that his ""heart jumps occasionally"" but there was no further annotations from the physician, nor were there any indications that the Veteran was going to be referred for follow-up."
3923|6377|1608262P47S4|1608262|False|Sentence|The representative has asserted that these symptoms constituted the onset of, or manifestations of, the Veteran's currently diagnosed anxiety disorder.
3924|6378|1608262P48S1|1608262|False|Sentence|The Board appreciates the representative's thorough review of the file and zealous representation.
3925|6379|1608262P48S2|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|However, while the representative pointed out several symptoms that the representative felt might be indicative of the onset of an anxiety disorder, the fact remains that there is no medical evidence of record endorsing the representative's suggestions.
3926|6380|1608262P48S3|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|This is highly relevant in that the representative has not been shown to have the medical training or expertise to link in-service symptoms to a current psychiatric diagnosis.
3927|6381|1608262P48S4|1608262|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
3928|6382|1608262P48S5|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, VA has obtained a highly detailed and thorough medical opinion explaining specifically why the Veteran's anxiety disorder neither began during nor was otherwise caused by his military service.
3929|6384|1608262P48S6|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|In providing that opinion, the examiner noted that she had conducted an approximate 20 hour review of the Veteran's claims file.
3930|6385|1608262P48S7|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the representative's statement does not establish service connection and does not trigger the duty to assist.
3931|6386|1608262P49S1|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|As discussed, the medical evidence is squarely against the suggestions that the Veteran's anxiety disorder had its onset in service or within a year of service discharge or is otherwise etiologically related to service.
3932|6387|1608262P49S2|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|The record contains no evidence of any mental health symptoms in service, at discharge, and after his separation from service until he started treating for substance abuse in 2004 (as explained by the VA examiner following an extensive claims file review).
3933|6388|1608262P49S3|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|There is also no competent medical opinion of record which relates the Veteran's anxiety disorder to his service.
3934|6391|1608262P49S4|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|To the contrary, as stated, the VA examiner clearly indicated that the Veteran only had extremely mild symptoms of anxiety.
3935|6393|1608262P49S5|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, the examiner reported that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria for bipolar disorder, panic disorder, adjustment disorder, or psychotic disorder.
3936|6395|1608262P49S6|1608262|False|EvidenceSentence|Finally, the VA examiner opined that there was no relationship between the Veteran's anxiety disorder and his active service as the Veteran's current very mild anxiety symptoms were most likely related to his current life difficulties.
3937|6396|1608262P50S1|1608262|False|LegalRuleSentence|While the Veteran was diagnosed with personality disorder, service connection may not be awarded for personality disorders.
3938|6397|1608262P50S2|1608262|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.303(c).
3939|6398|1608262P51S1|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report what comes to him through his senses, but he lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of an anxiety disorder.
3940|6399|1608262P51S2|1608262|False|CitationSentence|See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
3941|6400|1608262P51S3|1608262|False|LegalRuleSentence|In Jandreau, the Federal Circuit specifically determined that a lay person is not considered competent to testify when the issue was medically complex, as with an acquired psychiatric disorder.
3942|6401|1608262P51S4|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, while the Veteran disagrees with the conclusion that his anxiety disorder neither began during, nor was otherwise caused by, his military service, he is not considered competent (meaning medical qualified) to address the etiology of his psychiatric disorder.
3943|6402|1608262P51S5|1608262|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, his opinion is insufficient to provide the requisite nexus.
3944|6405|1608262P52S1|1608262|False|FindingSentence|In summary, as the evidence is against the claim, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is not warranted.

3950|6412|1534347P24S1|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's claim of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder is based on his contention that his conditions are related to his military service.
3951|6414|1534347P24S2|1534347|False|FindingSentence|For the following reasons, the Board finds that entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder has been established.
3952|6415|1534347P25S1|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection means that a veteran has a current disability resulting from disease or injury incurred in or aggravated by active service.

3954|6417|1534347P25S3|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection may be granted for any disease diagnosed after discharge when the evidence shows that the disease was incurred in service.
3955|6418|1534347P25S4|1534347|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.303(d).
3956|6419|1534347P26S1|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|"Service connection is established when the following elements are satisfied: (1) the existence of a current disability; (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury; and (3) a causal relationship or ""medical nexus"" between the current disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service."

3958|6421|1534347P27S1|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|A veteran is considered to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service, except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at entrance into service, or where clear and unmistakable evidence demonstrates that an injury or disease existed before acceptance and enrollment and was not aggravated by such service.
3959|6422|1534347P27S2|1534347|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. § 1111.
3960|6423|1534347P27S3|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|A history of conditions existing prior to service recorded at the time of the entrance examination does not constitute a notation of such conditions for the purpose of establishing whether the Veteran was of sound condition at enlistment.
3961|6424|1534347P27S4|1534347|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(b)(1).
3962|6425|1534347P27S5|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the recording of such a history in the entrance examination will be considered together with all other material evidence in determinations as to inception of the disability at issue.

3964|6427|1534347P28S1|1534347|False|LegalRuleSentence|In order to rebut the presumption of sound condition, VA must show by clear and unmistakable (obvious or manifest) evidence both (1) that the disease or injury existed prior to service and (2) that the disease or injury was not aggravated by service.

3998|6461|1534347P34S1|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders throughout his life, including major depressive disorder and PTSD.
3999|6462|1534347P34S2|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|Although there were no acquired psychiatric disorders noted at entry into service, the record shows, and the Veteran has testified that he had been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders prior to his entry into service.
4000|6463|1534347P34S3|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the Board must determine whether the presumption of soundness has been rebutted.

4002|6467|1534347P34S5|1534347|False|FindingSentence|For the following reasons, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted.
4003|6468|1534347P35S1|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's October 1984 entrance examination report does not note any psychiatric problems.
4004|6470|1534347P35S2|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness attaches.

4006|6473|1534347P36S1|1534347|False|FindingSentence|There is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder preexisted service.
4007|6475|1534347P36S2|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|More specifically, an October 1984 consultation sheet states that the Veteran was referred by his school to a psychiatrist at age 16 and that he received treatment for two years.
4008|6477|1534347P36S3|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, a March 2006 letter from a community mental health clinic confirms that the Veteran participated in an intake assessment at the clinic in November 1979 and that his file was closed in January 1981.
4009|6479|1534347P36S4|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|Finally, the Veteran has repeatedly stated that he was treated for a psychiatric disorder prior to entering service.
4010|6481|1534347P36S5|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Thus, there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran had an acquired psychiatric disorder prior to his active duty.
4011|6483|1534347P37S1|1534347|False|FindingSentence|However, the record does not contain clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was not aggravated by service.
4012|6484|1534347P37S2|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|In fact, the medical evidence in the record suggests the opposite.
4013|6486|1534347P37S3|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, in the February 1998 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with major depression with psychotic features and stated that the Veteran described symptoms of major depression during service.
4014|6488|1534347P37S4|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, while describing the Veteran's diagnosis of major depression in a January 2002 letter, the Veteran's private physician discussed the Veteran's childhood trauma that was exacerbated by his military experience and led to a hospitalization for depression.
4015|6490|1534347P37S5|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|"Finally, in a September 2004 letter, the Veteran's VA physician stated that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric conditions ""clearly intensified during his military experience."""
4016|6493|1534347P37S6|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Thus, VA has not met its burden to rebut the presumption of soundness, as the evidence is either favorable or in equipoise as to whether or not the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder was aggravated by active service.
4017|6495|1534347P37S7|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the second element of service connection is established and benefits may not be deducted on the basis of evidence of pre-existence of an acquired psychiatric disorder.
4018|6496|1534347P37S8|1534347|False|CitationSentence|See Wagner, 370 F.3d at 1096.
4019|6498|1534347P38S1|1534347|False|FindingSentence|As to the first and third elements of service connection, the Veteran has consistently been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders since he was in service and throughout the pendency of this claim.
4020|6502|1534347P38S2|1534347|False|EvidenceSentence|More specifically, the diagnoses of PTSD and/or depression are noted in service treatment records (when he was his spouse's dependent) dated September 1992 and October 1992; letters from private physicians dated  November 1993, January 1998, January 2002, and March 2002; and VA treatment records dated February 1998; March and August 2001; March, April, June, July, and December 2002; September and October 2003; February and September 2004; January, April, August, and October 2005; January, February, April, July, and November 2006; January, June, and September 2007; January and May 2008; April, May, July, September, and December 2010; January 2011; March, April, June, August, and October 2012; January, April, July, August, October, and November 2013; January, February, April, June, August, September, October, and December 2014; and January and March 2015, as well as many others.
4021|6504|1534347P38S3|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder and it has been continuously treated since his time in service.
4022|6506|1534347P38S4|1534347|False|FindingSentence|A nexus between the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder and his period of active service is likewise established with the findings of aggravation reflected in the September 2004 letter from the Veteran's VA physician.
4023|6507|1534347P38S5|1534347|False|ReasoningSentence|All of this evidence indicates that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of or a continuation of the disorders he had in service.
4024|6510|1534347P39S1|1534347|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the claim, service connection is warranted for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.

4039|6533|1315144P54S10|1315144|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board also notes that the Veteran's service personnel records do not corroborate any service in Guam.
4040|6535|1315144P54S11|1315144|False|FindingSentence|Given the foregoing, there is no credible supporting evidence that the claimed in-service stressors occurred.

4049|6551|1315144P56S6|1315144|False|ReasoningSentence|Rather, VA mental health treatment records reveal that the Veteran's PTSD is related to his childhood and to his reported physical abuse.

4052|6557|1315144P57S2|1315144|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board does not find this assertion, made during a VA examination after the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD was received, to be credible.
4053|6558|1315144P57S3|1315144|False|ReasoningSentence|Rather, it finds the assertions made prior to the date on which the Veteran filed for service connection for PTSD more probative.

4055|6560|1315144P57S5|1315144|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's credibility is also diminished in light of his step mother's report of witnessing one incident during which his father chased him with a fireplace log and struck him.

4190|6734|1505726P64S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|The following evidence of record is either favorable or somewhat favorable to the Veteran's PTSD claim:
4191|6736|1505726P65S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2009 private counselor report, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD, polysubstance dependence, and an impulse control disorder not otherwise specified.
4192|6739|1505726P65S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The private counselor indicated that the Veteran appeared confused about the events in his life and appeared to be experiencing flashbacks and intrusive memories associated with his experience in the Navy.
4193|6741|1505726P65S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that those experiences appeared to have been repressed until recently and that the Veteran had recently reached an understanding of how he engaged in self-destructive coping mechanisms throughout his adult life.
4194|6743|1505726P65S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|This understanding appeared to have caused a period of crisis due to PTSD, which required further monitoring and treatment.
4195|6744|1505726P65S5|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, this private report by itself does not provide a basis to grant the claim, as there is no indication testing for PTSD was based in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).
4196|6746|1505726P66S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In April 2013, a private psychologist, J.L., PsyD, after DSM-IV testing, and a review of pertinent records provided by the Veteran, found that the Veteran met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
4197|6748|1505726P66S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He demonstrated PTSD symptoms in all four major categories outlined in the DSM-IV TR, (A through D), including presence of traumatic event (two sexual assaults by Navy personnel), re-experiencing, avoidance, and increased arousal.
4198|6750|1505726P66S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, he has associated major depressive episodes.
4199|6753|1505726P66S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in making this determination, J.L. acknowledged that, when the Veteran was administered the Trauma Symptoms Inventory test, a self-report measure designed to delineate and gain a better understanding of the symptoms that result from a traumatic experienced, the Veteran's scores were invalid.
4200|6755|1505726P66S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran's pattern of answering may be ""somewhat exaggerated and the interpretation should be read with this in mind."""
4201|6757|1505726P66S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|J.L. added that it was notable that the Veteran's objective assessment measures were notably skewed and the above Trauma Symptoms Inventory test was invalid.
4202|6761|1505726P66S7|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran appeared to be motivated to portray himself in a more negative light, as reflected by his skewed assessment data, according to J.L. Despite his overreporting of symptoms, J.L. still opined that the Veteran had PTSD due to his sexual assaults in-service. J.L. did not identify what led her to make this conclusion, in light of the Veteran's credibility issues and invalid test scores.  The Veteran appeared to be motivated to portray himself in a more negative light, as reflected by his skewed assessment data, according to J.L.
4203|6763|1505726P66S9|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Despite his overreporting of symptoms, J.L. still opined that the Veteran had PTSD due to his sexual assaults in-service.
4204|6765|1505726P66S10|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|J.L. did not identify what led her to make this conclusion, in light of the Veteran's credibility issues and invalid test scores.
4205|6766|1505726P66S11|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, this examination provides some evidence in support of the PTSD claim, but is of limited probative value.
4206|6768|1505726P67S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, a VA psychologist, in a February 2014 VA mental health evaluation, diagnosed the Veteran with PTSD due to military sexual trauma.
4207|6770|1505726P67S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|She indicated that her evaluation of the Veteran was thorough.
4208|6773|1505726P67S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychologist noted that the Veteran endorsed nightmares three to four times per week with significant physiological response that has been so significant it prompted him going to the hospital.
4209|6775|1505726P67S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"Additionally, when discussing the event even briefly, the Veteran was ""notably anxious, hands shaking, voice quivering."""
4210|6779|1505726P67S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported very restless sleep, and he stated that it is extremely difficult for him to talk about his trauma and he avoids any crowded places.
4211|6781|1505726P67S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran indicated that he attempted to apply for a part-time job and was unable to stay for the interview because there were too many people and he fled the situation.
4212|6783|1505726P67S7|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also mentioned a lot of difficulty with emotional numbing, feeling cut off from others, and using substances for years to manage his symptoms.
4213|6785|1505726P67S8|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychologist assessed the Veteran as being very hypervigilant with high startle response.
4214|6787|1505726P67S9|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychologist concluded the Veteran clearly meets the criteria for PTSD-chronic with depression related to military sexual trauma.
4215|6788|1505726P67S10|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|However, in making this conclusion, the VA psychologist did not review all of the relevant evidence of record in making his determination, including the Veteran's inconsistent denial of PTSD symptoms, denial of in-service sexual trauma in one instance, and previous exaggerated and invalid psychological testing.
4216|6789|1505726P67S11|1505726|False|LegalRuleSentence|"The Court has held that a VA medical examiner's conclusions were of ""questionable probative value"" when the examiner failed to consider certain relevant information."

4218|6791|1505726P67S13|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, this VA psycholoigcal evaluation is entitled to limited probative value in support of the claim.
4219|6794|1505726P68S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran has also submitted a November 2008 National Center for PTSD factsheet, which stated that men and boys ""who have been sexually assaulted are more likely to suffer from PTSD and other anxiety disorders and depression than those who have never been abused sexually."""
4220|6796|1505726P68S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"Moreover, the Veteran submitted a March 2009 medical treatise article titled ""Coping Strategies Used by Hypersexual Patients to Defend Against the Painful Effects of Shame."""
4221|6798|1505726P68S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The article concluded that, based on studies, hypersexual people are often hiding prior shame or trauma, which can be linked to PTSD.

4226|6803|1505726P68S8|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|These medical treatise documents provide some limited evidence in support of the PTSD claim, but they do not provide sufficient corroborating evidence that in-service sexual assaults as alleged by the Veteran actually occurred in his case.
4227|6804|1505726P68S9|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|They also do not specifically address the facts of the Veteran's case.
4228|6805|1505726P69S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Conversely, the following evidence of record is unfavorable towards the Veteran's PTSD claim:
4229|6807|1505726P70S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In a May 2005 VA mental health database record, prior to the Veteran filing his claim for VA compensation for PTSD based on sexual assault, the Veteran specifically denied any history of sexual abuse while in the military.
4230|6808|1505726P70S2|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This denial contradicts and is inconsistent with his subsequent detailed allegations regarding alleged in-service sexual abuse.

4232|6810|1505726P70S4|1505726|False|LegalRuleSentence|In this regard, contemporaneous evidence can have greater probative value than inconsistent testimony provided by the claimant at a later date.

4234|6815|1505726P71S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|An August 2008 VA psychological examiner noted that the Veteran's reports of memories of abuse is inconsistent - he first says he began having memories of abuse in 2004 while writing his autobiography, but later says memories surfaced during an interview with a nurse at the VA only several months earlier.
4235|6816|1505726P72S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|In addition, the Veteran submitted a January 2010 stressor statement that is inconsistent with his numerous other stressor statements.
4236|6818|1505726P72S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"In the January 2010 statement, the Veteran remarked that he had been raped and molested ""by maybe 15 Officers and enlisted men by the time of my discharge."""
4237|6819|1505726P72S3|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This statement is wholly inconsistent with the various other stressor statements submitted by the Veteran during the appeal in which he repeatedly only discussed two to three specific instances of sexual abuse.
4238|6820|1505726P72S4|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Such exaggeration places the credibility of the Veteran's assertions in question.

4241|6824|1505726P73S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also submitted a November 2009 buddy statement in email form from an individual who served with the Veteran.

4245|6832|1505726P73S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"Rather, the harassment was a way ""of testing to see if you fit and adapted to submarine life and could be trusted to perform when needed."""
4246|6835|1505726P73S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted later by the September 2013 VA examiner, this buddy statement was in the context of men being forced to adapt to close quarters.
4247|6836|1505726P73S7|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|It does not demonstrate evidence of claimed sexual trauma.
4248|6838|1505726P74S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|At a June 2008 VA mental health consultation, the Veteran expressed a primary goal of obtaining documentation so that he might obtain service connection or other benefits as related to negative experiences in the Navy.
4249|6840|1505726P74S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He brought an excerpt from his autobiography that he was writing which outlined negative attention (sexualized and otherwise) that he and other seamen had received upon joining the Blue Jackets Choir and the Drum and Bugle Corps in the Navy.
4250|6842|1505726P74S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA provider determined that the Veteran did not meet any of the criteria for PTSD based on his reported stressors.
4251|6844|1505726P74S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The provider also indicated that she was unable to determine the definitive effects of any such military experiences.
4252|6848|1505726P74S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran described the related experiences to the VA provider and reported amazement that they had occurred, but he did not characterize them as traumatic.
4253|6849|1505726P74S6|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA mental health consultation provides some evidence against the claim.
4254|6851|1505726P75S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2008 VA infectious disease note observed that the Veteran's version of military experiences that day was different that those noted in the past.
4255|6854|1505726P75S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA provider noted that the Veteran's report of having 22,000 post-service sexual partners, consisting of partners 5 days a week for 35 years with up to 22 partners on a weekend seemed high, and that he appeared ""more interested in compensation"" than in dealing with his problems."
4256|6855|1505726P75S3|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA record provides some evidence against the PTSD claim.
4257|6857|1505726P76S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a June 2012 VA screen for PTSD was negative.
4258|6859|1505726P76S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran denied PTSD symptoms of avoidance, hypervigilance, numbness, or detachment.
4259|6861|1505726P77S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Finally, the RO secured a September 2013 VA psychiatric examination and opinion with regard to the Veteran's PTSD claim.
4260|6863|1505726P77S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|This report discussed all of the medical and lay evidence of record in detail.
4261|6865|1505726P77S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist determined that the Veteran did not have a PTSD diagnosis that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria (A through E).
4262|6867|1505726P77S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran denied abuse as a youth.
4263|6869|1505726P77S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He stated that his brother would pick on him, but this was not severe.
4264|6872|1505726P77S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He reported that his statements about homosexuality were coerced in the military and that he was instructed not to discuss the alleged rapes.
4265|6874|1505726P77S7|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also indicated that his anxiety problems and depressive symptoms began in 2005, when he began having panic attacks and temper problems due to co-worker difficulties, and in the context of other post-military stressors.
4266|6876|1505726P77S8|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist noted post-service life stressors, such as physical issues after a recent car accident; the recent death of his mother; the death of his younger brother; the loss of his job in 2005; the death of his father; his HIV treatment; and the loss of his business and partner in 1992.
4267|6878|1505726P77S9|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran described chronic difficulty with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
4268|6881|1505726P78S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatrist also concluded that there is no objective evidence in service treatment records of any markers which would support claimed sexual traumas of harassment and physical rape or assault.
4269|6883|1505726P78S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|There was no evidence of negative performance reviews, demotions, disciplinary actions, AWOLs, or Article 15s.
4270|6885|1505726P78S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|There was no evidence of medical visits for physical injury or emotional distress noted in service treatment records.
4271|6888|1505726P78S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|His claim that his in-service statement about homosexuality was falsified could not be confirmed without resort to speculation.
4272|6890|1505726P78S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, the claimed stressor was not supported by objective evidence which will fulfill criterion A for PTSD.
4273|6892|1505726P78S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's written statement dated in August 1968 in service personnel records regarding homosexuality does not constitute evidence of reduced work performance on duty or any other pathology, as homosexuality in and of itself is not deemed a psychiatric or medical disorder.
4274|6895|1505726P78S7|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, the VA psychiatrist determined that the claimed stressor could not be verified or supported by the evidence, and thus does not meet criterion A for PTSD.
4275|6897|1505726P78S8|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, with regard to PTSD criteria B through F, the VA psychiatrist assessed that the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD in that there was no re-experiencing of the traumatic event, no persistent avoidance of stimuli, and no numbing of general responsiveness.
4276|6899|1505726P78S9|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The fact that he met his long-term partner during service is not indicative of the avoidance criteria that would be expected in the context of traumatic rape in the military.
4277|6901|1505726P78S10|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Rather, the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology was assessed as depressive disorder, NOS, along with a history of polysubstance abuse.
4278|6903|1505726P78S11|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|His cocaine abuse in 2005 was part of a period of post-service excessive stress, his personality disorder, and his lifestyle choices.
4279|6905|1505726P78S12|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He also has a diagnosis of a personality disorder with narcissistic and histrionic traits.
4280|6907|1505726P78S13|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran did well upon discharge from the military and held a job and a long-term love relationship for decades and did not seek out mental health care.
4281|6908|1505726P78S14|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|His promiscuity is not a mental health disorder and is not in and of itself evidence of any claimed trauma.
4282|6911|1505726P79S1|1505726|False|FindingSentence|Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds that the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV) as a result of his alleged sexual assault stressors.
4283|6912|1505726P79S2|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, the September 2013 VA psychiatric examination in particular was very thorough, supported by explanations, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.
4284|6913|1505726P79S3|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|It also considered the lay and buddy statements of record.
4285|6914|1505726P79S4|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA opinion, supported also by the other evidence listed above, outweighs the findings of the April 2013 private psychological evaluation on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV from alleged sexual assaults.
4286|6915|1505726P79S5|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|After an extensive interview and psychological testing, the VA examiner provided greater detail in assessing whether the Veteran met each of the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD than any other private or VA provider.
4287|6917|1505726P79S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner also pointed out the Veteran's instances of exaggeration and other inaccuracies.
4288|6918|1505726P79S7|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|In several instances, the Veteran was prone to exaggeration when testing for PTSD symptomatology.

4297|6927|1505726P81S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|That notwithstanding, in the instant case, the Board has found the Veteran's lay statements are less probative than the post-service medical evidence finding that the Veteran does not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, based on alleged in-service sexual assaults.
4298|6928|1505726P81S2|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|The overall evidence of record is not supportive of behavioral changes showing that these assaults actually occurred.
4299|6929|1505726P81S3|1505726|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.

4303|6935|1505726P82S2|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board has weighed the evidence of record to make a determination whether the occurrence of the alleged stressor was sufficiently corroborated, to include evidence of a reported assault and behavior changes in service records, VA opinions, private opinions, lay statements, and VA treatment evidence.
4304|6938|1505726P82S3|1505726|False|FindingSentence|In other words, the Board has considered all available evidence relevant to the Veteran's attempt to corroborate the occurrence of the alleged sexual assault stressors, but has found that insufficient credible, probative evidence that these sexual assaults actually occurred.
4305|6941|1505726P83S1|1505726|False|FindingSentence|Although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the preponderance of the evidence is service connection for PTSD.

4308|6945|1505726P85S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|As discussed above, the Veteran attributes his current depression and anxiety to alleged traumatic events from his Navy service.
4309|6946|1505726P86S1|1505726|False|Sentence|The Board has considered whether the Veteran's PTSD claim raised the issue of whether service connection is warranted for any other acquired psychiatric disorder in addition to PTSD.

4315|6954|1505726P87S5|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, there is some indication that the Veteran's current symptoms arise from a psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.
4316|6955|1505726P87S6|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, in the present case, the Board cannot limit its analysis of the Veteran's claim solely to PTSD.
4317|6956|1505726P87S7|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, his claim potentially encompasses psychiatric conditions other than PTSD that are reasonably raised by the record.
4318|6958|1505726P88S1|1505726|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, upon review of the evidence of record, Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.

4331|6981|1505726P90S7|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, it cannot be said that the evidence clearly and unmistakably shows that the Veteran had a preexisting psychiatric disorder.
4332|6982|1505726P90S8|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, the Board's analysis must turn to the issue of whether a current psychiatric disorder was incurred during the Veteran's active service.

4338|6989|1505726P91S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the Board emphasizes that the September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner specifically stated the following:
4339|6991|1505726P92S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|There is no evidence to suggest diagnosable Axis I mental disorder pre-military.
4340|6993|1505726P92S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Veteran has variably reported anxiety due to peer pressure, some excessive alcohol use and sexual interactions with both sexes in youth.
4341|6996|1505726P92S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|These behaviors in and of themselves are not proof of any formal psychiatric disorder in pre-military; he was not diagnosed or formally treated for any specific psychiatric disorder prior to military.
4342|6997|1505726P92S4|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Behaviors most likely relate to beginning examples of maladaptive choices which later progressed to styles consistent with Personality disorder.
4343|6998|1505726P92S5|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Enlistment papers showed complaints of mild anxiety pre-military, however, subjective mild anxiety is not an indication of formal mental disorder.
4344|6999|1505726P92S6|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Likewise, he has variably reported bisexual and homosexual tendencies prior to military, but these lifestyle choices regarding sexual orientation are not specific to any diagnosable mental disorder per DSM-IV.
4345|7000|1505726P92S7|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, since no specific formal diagnosis existed premilitary, no exacerbation statement is deemed necessary with regard to post military diagnoses rendered below.
4346|7001|1505726P93S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|With regard to a nexus of current depression to his service in the Navy, the record reflects several favorable and unfavorable medical opinions of record.

4352|7010|1505726P94S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He was referred to a mental health provider.
4353|7012|1505726P94S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|At a June 2008 VA mental health consultation, the Veteran expressed a primary goal of obtaining documentation so that he might obtain service connection or other benefits as related to negative experiences in the Navy.
4354|7015|1505726P94S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|He brought an excerpt from his autobiography that he was writing which outlined negative attention (sexualized and otherwise) that he and other seamen had received upon joining the Blue Jackets Choir and the Drum and Bugle Corps in the Navy.
4355|7018|1505726P94S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA provider determined that the Veteran does not meet any of the criteria for PTSD based on his reported stressors.
4356|7020|1505726P94S7|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The provider also indicated that she was unable to determine the definitive effects of any such military experiences.
4357|7023|1505726P94S8|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran described the related experiences to the VA provider and reported amazement that they had occurred, but he did not characterize them as traumatic.
4358|7025|1505726P95S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In a June 2008 statement from Dr. M.W., PhD., it was concluded that the Veteran's military experiences could not be confirmed nor ruled out as a contributing factor in his present depression.
4359|7027|1505726P95S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran was bullied, threatened, traumatized, and sexually harassed by older people who were in positions of power above.

4361|7031|1505726P96S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|During an August 2008 VA psychological examination, the Veteran was diagnosed with depressive disorder and substance abuse in remission.
4362|7033|1505726P96S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that he could not resolve the issue of whether that diagnosis was related to the Veteran's military service without resort to mere speculation.
4363|7035|1505726P96S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In so doing, he noted that the Veteran's reports of depression, anger, and difficulty interacting with authority figures were vague and that his memories of abuse were inconsistent.
4364|7037|1505726P96S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, the Veteran had reported experiencing emotional and physical abuse by his older brother in childhood.
4365|7039|1505726P96S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|For these reasons, the examiner could not resolve the etiology of his disorder.
4366|7040|1505726P96S6|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|This opinion is expressed in language too vague and speculative to establish a plausible relationship between current depression and the veteran's service.

4369|7045|1505726P97S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychologist also found that the Veteran meets the criteria for recurrent major depressive disorder which is likely largely exacerbated by his PTSD.
4370|7046|1505726P97S3|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board again notes that PTSD is not a service-connected disability
4371|7048|1505726P98S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In light of the conflicting and inconclusive evidence discussed above, in September 2013, the RO secured a VA psychiatric examination and opinion.
4372|7050|1505726P98S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|This report discussed all of the medical and lay evidence of record in detail.
4373|7052|1505726P98S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist determined that the Veteran's current diagnosis of depressive disorder NOS was less likely caused by or related to his military experiences, but rather a combination of post-service stressors.
4374|7054|1505726P98S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran was discharged from the military in 1968 and did not report or seek treatment for his anxiety problems and depressive symptoms until many years after service in 2005, when he began having panic attacks and temper problems due to co-worker difficulties, and in the context of other post-military stressors.
4375|7056|1505726P98S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist noted post-service life stressors, such as physical issues after a recent car accident; the recent death of his mother; the death of his younger brother; the loss of his job in 2005; the death of his father; his HIV treatment, and the loss of his business and partner in 1992.
4376|7058|1505726P98S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran described chronic difficulty with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
4377|7060|1505726P99S1|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner reasoned that the Veteran's written statement dated in August 1968 in service personnel records regarding homosexuality does not constitute evidence of reduced work performance on duty or any other pathology, as homosexuality in and of itself is not deemed a psychiatric or medical disorder.
4378|7062|1505726P99S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted the Veteran did well upon discharge from the military and held a job and a long-term love relationship for decades, and he did not seek out mental health care.
4379|7064|1505726P99S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|His promiscuity is not a mental health disorder and is not in and of itself evidence of any claimed trauma.
4380|7066|1505726P99S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|"Additionally, the buddy statements submitted by the Veteran's brother and other acquaintances that the Veteran had ""changed"" following his military service are ""vague."""
4381|7068|1505726P99S5|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|In summary, the VA examiner assessed that the Veteran's depression occurred in the context of several post-military life stressors.
4382|7070|1505726P99S6|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The anxiety episodes are infrequent and occurred in the context of post-service cocaine abuse and overlap with his atrial fibrillation symptoms.
4383|7071|1505726P100S1|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, the September 2013 VA psychiatric examination was thorough, based on a review of the evidence of record, and supported by a detailed rationale.
4384|7072|1505726P100S2|1505726|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Court has stated that an examination or opinion is adequate when it sufficiently informs the Board of a medical expert's judgment on a medical question and the essential rationale for that opinion.

4387|7075|1505726P100S5|1505726|False|ReasoningSentence|For these reasons, the Board finds that the unfavorable September 2013 VA examination and opinion outweighs any favorable evidence of record, which is nowhere near as detailed and well-explained.

4403|7096|1505726P103S2|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner assessed the Veteran's personality disorder was unrelated to the Veteran's military experiences, as it was due to childhood development as evidenced by lifelong maladaptive coping styles.
4404|7098|1505726P103S3|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner added that his personality disorder encompasses interpersonal difficulties, maladaptive choices, and impulsivity.
4405|7100|1505726P103S4|1505726|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's current impairment was equally caused by depression and personality disorder symptoms, according to the VA examiner.

4429|7136|1302554P20S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|4. The Veteran did not have a psychiatric disorder in service that was unrelated to the use of drugs.
4430|7138|1302554P21S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|5. The preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service or was aggravated during service.
4431|7139|1302554P24S1|1302554|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
4432|7140|1302554P110S1|1302554|False|Sentence|Analysis
4433|7143|1302554P111S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|After reviewing all of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that was caused or aggravated by his service.
4434|7146|1302554P111S2|1302554|False|FindingSentence|In regard to direct service connection, although the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression or major depressive disorder subsequent to service, his most current examination shows that the Veteran either does not have depression or that any current depression is unrelated to the Veteran's military service.
4435|7149|1302554P111S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|While the Veteran claimed that he was depressed and suicidal in service, the Veteran was admitted for inpatient treatment for substance induced psychosis in 1978 and no mention of any depression or suicidal thinking was made at that time or any other time in service.
4436|7150|1302554P111S4|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, his memories are contradicted by the more reliable contemporaneous evidence.
4437|7152|1302554P111S5|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, no diagnosis of depression was made until 1985, six years after the Veteran's service, and at that time there was also no indication that the Veteran's service had anything to do with his depression.
4438|7153|1302554P111S6|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, even if the Veteran does have depression, this occurred after service and the evidence shows it was not caused by service.
4439|7154|1302554P112S1|1302554|False|Sentence|The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements.
4440|7157|1302554P112S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, although the statement from J.P.S. indicates that he was aware of the sexual trauma from the karate instructor at the time the Veteran started his active duty, the Veteran has said that he did not tell anyone of this until 1991 or, in the case of his family, until later.
4441|7160|1302554P112S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, even though the Veteran enlisted in the USMCR in August 1975, it is his contention that he realized he must leave active duty upon reporting for training in January 1976 to deal with his situation.
4442|7162|1302554P112S4|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The statement of J.P.S. tends to support this view of events by the Veteran.
4443|7163|1302554P112S5|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|However, it strains credulity to accept this information as the Veteran had months before service to change his mind about going on active duty.
4444|7165|1302554P112S6|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, he reported that he had no psychiatric problems at the time of his enlistment physical.
4445|7166|1302554P112S7|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|He also received a meritorious promotion upon completion of basic training, a fact that is in stark contrast with his assertions of not being able to function and wanting to commit suicide during basic training.
4446|7168|1302554P113S1|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|No other supporting lay statement has knowledge of the Veteran's actual service.
4447|7170|1302554P113S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The statement from G.S. relates to what he knew of the Veteran prior to service.
4448|7172|1302554P113S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The same is true of the statement from P.D.
4449|7173|1302554P113S4|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|It is clear that both individuals thought highly of the Veteran and that they had positive relationships.
4450|7175|1302554P113S5|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Neither individual could, or did, address the Veteran's status in service.
4451|7176|1302554P113S6|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, they also are not aware of all of the facts in this matter and their challenges to determinations made or evidence contained in the record have no credibility.
4452|7178|1302554P113S7|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran himself has provided the statements, in regard to his sexual activities, drug use and religious practices to his care providers on multiple occasions, particularly in regard to his pre-service drug abuse.
4453|7180|1302554P113S8|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|As stated several times, his mother has confirmed the Veteran's pre-service drug use.
4454|7182|1302554P113S9|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|She has also related that she had difficulty in coping with the Veteran and his behavior.
4455|7183|1302554P114S1|1302554|False|Sentence|The Veteran claims that he also has PTSD that is related to his service.
4456|7184|1302554P114S2|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|The May 2008 letter from the VA physician does not support the Veteran's claim.
4457|7186|1302554P114S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|He noted the Veteran was treated in the clinic for PTSD related to the pre-service sexual trauma.
4458|7188|1302554P114S4|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician noted that, as a routine, a check of a veteran's DD 214 is done to review for stressors.
4459|7189|1302554P114S5|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|He did not relate any military stressors for this Veteran and his DD 214 would not indicate any as the Veteran was not in combat and has not alleged such service.
4460|7191|1302554P115S1|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was examined three times.
4461|7193|1302554P115S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|On two of those occasions, the Veteran was found to have PTSD that was related to child abuse and not anything that occurred in the military.
4462|7195|1302554P115S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's treatment records also show a PTSD diagnosis that is related to the pre-service sexual abuse.
4463|7197|1302554P115S4|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|However, sexual abuse in the military could not be corroborated.
4464|7199|1302554P115S5|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The only military stressor that was corroborated was the fact that a Marine who was injured prior to when the Veteran arrived at his duty station later died while hospitalized.
4465|7201|1302554P115S6|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|However, there is no evidence linking any diagnosis of PTSD or any other mental disorder to this event.
4466|7203|1302554P116S1|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|On the third examination in May 2011, the Veteran was specifically evaluated for PTSD and was not found to even have this disorder.
4467|7204|1302554P116S2|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|This conclusion is highly probative insofar as it was made based on a review of the entire claims folder, including documentation of the Veteran's extensive substance abuse and treatment history and after consideration of the opinions of the earlier two VA examiners, who acknowledged that it was hard to diagnose the Veteran because his answers were often vague or off topic.
4468|7207|1302554P117S1|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The third examiner determined that the Veteran did not have any psychiatric diagnosis and that no psychiatric symptoms were aggravated specifically by the Veteran's military service.
4469|7210|1302554P117S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|While the two VA examiners who previously examined the Veteran opined that there may have been some minor aggravation of the Veteran's symptoms due to his military service, neither of them explained the mechanism through which this aggravation supposedly occurred or that there was evidence of PTSD in service.
4470|7212|1302554P117S3|1302554|False|FindingSentence|Notably, there is no credible evidence that any of the in-service events complained of by the Veteran, aside from the death of the recruit, actually occurred.
4471|7216|1302554P117S4|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|While one recruit who was unknown to the Veteran and injured prior to the Veteran arriving at his duty station died while hospitalized, there is no evidence that an additional four of the Veteran's friends died in service as he claimed.
4472|7217|1302554P117S5|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no credible evidence that the Veteran was physically or sexually assaulted in service; he did not advance these contentions until his appeal was well underway and he never provided any specifics about the supposed assaults, other than to say that he was once invited to another soldier's home, to which he apparently did not go.
4473|7221|1302554P118S1|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, while the Veteran contended that he reported childhood sexual abuse to his commander and was not allowed to go home to cope with it, documentation such as treatment records and even the written statement from the Veteran's mother indicate that the Veteran was unaware of the sexual abuse until long after his military service.
4474|7222|1302554P118S2|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Also, his outstanding performance, as documented in his personnel records, as well as the letter of recommendation by his company commander and the dining facility officer do not support a conclusion that the Veteran's performance waned upon his graduation from basic training and receipt of a meritorious promotion.
4475|7223|1302554P119S1|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|The three VA examination reports do not support a conclusion that a psychiatric disorder, other than the drug induced one from 1978, was present in service.
4476|7225|1302554P119S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The STRs are clearly negative for such evidence.
4477|7227|1302554P119S3|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran denied having any type of a psychiatric disorder, or history thereof, on his enlistment in the Navy in June 1981.
4478|7229|1302554P119S4|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|The post-service treatment records do not provide supporting evidence to conclude that a psychiatric condition existed in service that was unrelated to the Veteran's drug abuse.
4479|7231|1302554P120S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran had a psychiatric condition in service other than the two drug-related diagnoses from 1978.
4480|7233|1302554P120S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|It is clear from the 1978 discharge summary that the Veteran received extensive therapy and treatment over a two month period.
4481|7235|1302554P120S3|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|The diagnoses were not determined without what appears to be a thorough understanding of the Veteran's psychiatric status, at the time of treatment and prior to the period of hospitalization.
4482|7238|1302554P120S4|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|The history of drug abuse cited in the summary is supported by numerous admissions by the Veteran in his treatment by private and VA sources after service as well as by statements from his mother.
4483|7240|1302554P120S5|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no contrary competent medical evidence to show otherwise.
4484|7241|1302554P120S6|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection cannot be granted for disability due to intentional drug abuse.
4485|7242|1302554P120S7|1302554|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.301(d).
4486|7243|1302554P121S1|1302554|False|Sentence|As noted above, the Board was directed to address the issue of aggravation of a preexisting disability through consideration of the presumption of soundness.
4487|7247|1302554P121S2|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the evidence shows the Veteran did not report any psychiatric problems on his medical history in August 1975 and no psychiatric issues were identified at the time of the physical examination.
4488|7248|1302554P122S1|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, also as noted above, the Court has specifically held that, even in cases where the evidence later shows that there was a preexisting disability that was not identified on entry to service, the presumption of soundness does not necessarily apply.
4489|7249|1302554P122S2|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|More to the point, absent the showing of the manifestation or incurrence of a disease or injury in service, there is no disability to consider for possible aggravation.
4490|7250|1302554P122S3|1302554|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012).
4491|7251|1302554P122S4|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Court in Gilbert held that before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury - that was not noted upon entrance into service - manifested in service.
4492|7252|1302554P122S5|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|Otherwise stated, absent such manifestation, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
4493|7254|1302554P122S6|1302554|False|FindingSentence|That is the case here.
4494|7256|1302554P122S7|1302554|False|FindingSentence|No disability for which compensation may be paid (i.e, a disability which was not a drug induced psychiatric disorder) was manifest in service.
4495|7258|1302554P122S8|1302554|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
4496|7260|1302554P123S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|It is clear from the evidence of record that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD that is based on his sexual trauma prior to service.
4497|7261|1302554P123S2|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran has given a history of several incidents, his primary incident involves the karate instructor and this has been the basis for the diagnosis by various providers and examiners.
4498|7263|1302554P123S3|1302554|False|FindingSentence|The stressor is unrelated to service.
4499|7265|1302554P124S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|The Veteran's PTSD could not have been aggravated by his military service insofar as this implies that PTSD was present prior to, and during, the Veteran's service.
4500|7266|1302554P124S2|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|However, no psychiatric disorder other than organic brain syndrome due to drug abuse, which resolved, was present during service.
4501|7267|1302554P124S3|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board is of the opinion that the contemporaneous treatment records during service have the greatest probative value as to the Veteran's mental status at that time.
4502|7268|1302554P124S4|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|This is particularly true when weighed against lay statements such as those given by the Veteran or in various written statements from persons who knew him during and after service.
4503|7270|1302554P124S5|1302554|False|EvidenceSentence|PTSD also was not present when the Veteran was treated as an outpatient or when he was hospitalized in the 1980s.
4504|7271|1302554P124S6|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|This diagnosis did not appear until more than 20 years after the Veteran's service; therefore, it could not have been aggravated by service.
4505|7272|1302554P124S7|1302554|False|ReasoningSentence|Even more importantly, after a comprehensive review of all of the Veteran's treatment records and the prior medical opinions, the examiner who provided the May 2011 report of examination determined that the Veteran did not have PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder which could have been aggravated by service.
4506|7274|1302554P125S1|1302554|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service.
4507|7276|1302554P125S2|1302554|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board concludes that a psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.
4508|7277|1302554P125S3|1302554|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board acknowledges that VA is statutorily required to resolve the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an outstanding issue.

4519|7292|1630016P32S3|1630016|False|FindingSentence|In this case, the Board is granting service connection for PTSD; thus, any defect in the duties to notify and assist with respect to this claim is harmless error.

4539|7312|1630016P39S6|1630016|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board is also mindful that it cannot make its own independent medical determinations, and that there must be plausible reasons for favoring one medical opinion over another.

4542|7315|1630016P40S2|1630016|False|LegalRuleSentence|By reasonable doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or disprove the claim.

4553|7326|1630016P42S2|1630016|False|LegalRuleSentence|Instead, the record must contain credible supporting evidence that corroborates the veteran's testimony or statements.

4555|7328|1630016P43S1|1630016|False|ReasoningSentence|Because personal assault is an extremely personal and sensitive issue, many incidents are not officially reported, which creates a proof problem with respect to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
4556|7329|1630016P43S2|1630016|False|ReasoningSentence|In such situations, it is not unusual for there to be an absence of service records documenting the events the veteran has alleged.
4557|7330|1630016P43S3|1630016|False|ReasoningSentence|The victims of such trauma may not necessarily report the full circumstances of the trauma for many years after the trauma.
4558|7331|1630016P43S4|1630016|False|LegalRuleSentence|Thus, when a PTSD claim is based on in-service personal assault, evidence from sources other than the veteran's service records may corroborate the veteran's account of the stressor incident.

4586|7370|1630016P54S1|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|A VA examiner in July 2013 noted a diagnosis of PTSD secondary to the Veteran's MST; and, a separate diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) secondary to PTSD and childhood traumas.

4588|7374|1630016P54S3|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|Based on the Veteran's history and clinical examination, the examiner opined that the Veteran's current PTSD symptoms were, as likely as not, due to his MST and childhood traumas.
4589|7376|1630016P54S4|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported significant childhood physical, emotional and sexual molestation.
4590|7379|1630016P54S5|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|He did not receive consistent treatment for his pre-service trauma and it was not clear to the examiner whether those issues had resolved.
4591|7381|1630016P54S6|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|However, the Veteran reported that he was able to make peace with his mother regarding early physical and emotional abuse and also felt like he had dealt with the childhood sexual trauma.
4592|7383|1630016P54S7|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported to the examiner that the MST significantly negatively impacted his life.
4593|7385|1630016P54S8|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|He reported that immediately after the sexual assault occurred, which was traumatic, he was made fun of by others and called a derogatory name.
4594|7387|1630016P54S9|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported to the examiner that he used his pre-existing eye injury as a basis for discharge in order to get away from that environment.
4595|7390|1630016P54S10|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran could not understand why he was assaulted, and the randomness of the assault has, according to the examiner, contributed to his inability to resolve the issue.
4596|7392|1630016P55S1|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, the Veteran's Vet Center counselor also noted, in a November 2014 memorandum/psychological assessment, that the Veteran has PTSD due to his in-service MST.

4603|7403|1630016P58S2|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|T.M. noted that the Veteran was proud and enthusiastic when he was stationed in Alaska as an Air Force police officer.

4607|7412|1630016P58S6|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|He had become subdued, distant and distrustful of others.
4608|7415|1630016P58S7|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|T.M. noticed changes in the Veteran but the Veteran was always vague about what happened to him in service.
4609|7417|1630016P59S1|1630016|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the most probative evidence of record supports a finding that the Veteran's PTSD and major depression resulted from an in-service stressor.
4610|7418|1630016P59S2|1630016|False|ReasoningSentence|This is supported by a two competent medical opinions, and the eyewitness account of a drastic change in the Veteran's behavior before service compared to his behavior after service and the Veteran's credible assertions.
4611|7419|1630016P59S3|1630016|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, there is no contradictory opinion of record.
4612|7422|1630016P59S4|1630016|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner specifically linked the Veteran's PTSD to an undocumented personal assault in service; and, found credible the Veteran's reports that he found a way a medical reason to leave the Air Force shortly after the MST took place.

4625|7443|1431031P52S2|1431031|False|EvidenceSentence|Service treatment records from February 1974 note psychiatric problems prior to entering service.
4626|7445|1431031P52S3|1431031|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was given a mental health evaluation prior to acceptance for service.
4627|7447|1431031P52S4|1431031|False|EvidenceSentence|A pre-service history was noted, but no current neurosis or psychosis was found.
4628|7449|1431031P52S5|1431031|False|EvidenceSentence|Despite the noted history, the Veteran was found fit for duty without any psychiatric disability at the time of entrance into service.

4631|7452|1431031P52S8|1431031|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service.

4634|7457|1431031P52S11|1431031|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran has also not reported any mental health symptoms during service.
4635|7460|1431031P52S12|1431031|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application and there is no in-service incurrence of mental health problems.
4636|7461|1431031P53S1|1431031|False|LegalRuleSentence|Claims for service connection for PTSD require an in-service incurrence, or stressor, accompanied by credible and supporting evidence that the stressor claimed to be the cause of the disability occurred in service, or specific circumstances of combat or hostile military or terrorist activities consistent with the nature of said service.

4672|7512|1630402P24S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that he has PTSD as a result of his combat experiences as an underwater demolition team combat swimmer.
4673|7513|1630402P24S2|1630402|False|ReasoningSentence|As noted above, in order for the Veteran to be entitled to service connection for PTSD, the medical evidence must show a diagnosis of PTSD linked to an in-service stressor.
4674|7515|1630402P25S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|With respect the Veteran's claimed stressors, the record shows that he engaged in combat with the enemy as an underwater demolition team member; in June 1945, he was involved in a diving operation during which bombs exploded nearby, he suffered concussion injury, and one of his fellow teammates died.
4675|7518|1630402P25S2|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|"Service personnel records and DD 214s reflect that his military occupational specialty (MOS) was as an underwater demolition team combat swimmer from December 1949 to March 1955, a diver from March 1955 to December 1960, and a diver foreman from December 1960 to May 1964 and that he received various decorations, including Purple Heart and Bronze Start Medal with ""V"" device, which is indicative of combat participation."

4682|7531|1630402P28S2|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
4683|7534|1630402P28S3|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran had severe dementia and was unable to discuss the underwater incident in June 1945 and all details were provided by his wife.
4684|7537|1630402P28S4|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that there was insufficient evidence to diagnose PTSD due to no history of treatment or evidence of PTSD symptoms prior to dementia onset and the Veteran's inability to meaningfully participate in a clinical interview.
4685|7539|1630402P29S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|In contrast, a private psychiatrist, Dr. M.B., opined in May 2013 that it is much more likely than not that the alleged stressor events contributed directly to the occurrence of severe, chronic, delayed onset posttraumatic stress disorder in the Veteran's case.
4686|7543|1630402P29S2|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|In reaching this conclusion, Dr. B. initially noted that the Veteran demonstrated well the required clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis severe PTSD, chronic, delayed onset, in accordance with the DSM-IV, since 2007 to the present, based on his investigations and interviews, including family, fellow veteran combat swimmers, other foreign war veterans, health care team and other Navy diving medicine experts.
4687|7545|1630402P29S3|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|Dr. B. indicated that he was a national and miliary expert in the combined field of the psychiatry of military diving and the effect of disasters, trauma, and PTSD among Navy divers, and provided his insight as follows:
4688|7547|1630402P30S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|"Navy diving training always forges extreme mental physical and emotional ""toughness,"" with compartmentalization of negative emotions such as fear anxiety and grief which could get in the way of a mission."
4689|7549|1630402P30S2|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|This ingrained compartmentalization usually persists for years as a part of the diver's personality long after a Navy diving career is completed. . . .
4690|7552|1630402P30S3|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|Diver's psychological defenses are adaptively hardened from years of unexpected exposures to traumatic experiences; however, many years later, they can develop PTSD replaying and reliving in dramatic fashion those situations which caused physical injury intense fear and anxiety of being ambushed or coming under fire and grief over seeing and swimming among bodies and body parts of fellow divers.
4691|7554|1630402P30S4|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|This exactly describes what happened in [the Veteran's] life.
4692|7557|1630402P30S5|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|He experienced combat and came under attack repeatedly; this is documented in citations he received which are a matter of record in previous documents submitted on behalf of his appeals to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
4693|7559|1630402P30S6|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|Information about one of his serious wounds during combat, a traumatic brain injury, is also part of this file.
4694|7561|1630402P30S7|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|It was only until his brain expected aging in later life caused both structural brain decline as well as the decline of those ingrained psychological defenses; in 2007, this led to the beginning of a flooding of emotional responses to past wartime horrors.
4695|7563|1630402P30S8|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|He has replayed these situations over and over in public and in front of his health care providers at the Perry Point Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) as well as in the presence of his family members at home and at reunions of wartime combat and special warfare swimmers.
4696|7565|1630402P31S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|Email correspondence dated April 2013 between Dr. B and another physician reflects that they agreed that PTSD best described the Veteran's behavior which deluded him into thinking that the metal hair clamps of a female in the hospital hallway were improvised explosive devices which must be disarmed and made safe and he must protect the hospital and those in it from injury by enemy forces landing on the river bank and attacking.
4697|7569|1630402P32S1|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|"Dr. B. also reviewed the January 2012 VA examination report and pointed out that this determination was based upon the Veteran's lack of cooperation during one brief interview of several questions, to which he responded ""Ask my wife,"" but his wife was not allowed to provide information at this examination."
4698|7572|1630402P32S2|1630402|False|EvidenceSentence|"It was further noted that the Veteran's brief singular responses were actually direct manifestations of PTSD; avoidance of stimuli (conversation) that recall/relive the traumatic events; suspicious ness of a strange individual; and misperception that he was being interrogated by ""an enemy soldier"" in a POW situation and not cooperating to provide information which could betray his men and cause them harm and torture."
4699|7574|1630402P33S1|1630402|False|FindingSentence|Thus, there is evidence of record that indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his alleged combat stressors in service.
4700|7577|1630402P33S2|1630402|False|FindingSentence|Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his claimed in-service combat stressors.
4701|7581|1630402P33S3|1630402|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds service connection for PTSD is warranted.

4736|7630|1715225P46S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|A July 1971 private medical record, by Dr. G. H. Weaver diagnosed a July 1971 motorcycle accident; the Veteran had right oculomotor palsy and cerebral injury with residual weakness of the right upper extremity and vertigo.
4737|7632|1715225P46S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|In February 1975, Dr. Weaver found that the Veteran was unable to do any manual labor, work requiring operation of a vehicle, work around any dangerous machinery - considering his poor cerebral function he probably is unable to learn a trade which would require dexterity and rapid mental functioning or a good memory.
4738|7634|1715225P47S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The record is silent for decades as to any complaints of, or treatment for, a psychiatric disorder.
4739|7636|1715225P47S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The first record of psychiatric diagnosis is an October 1999 private medical record, which found that the Veteran has a history of depression secondary to general medical condition or history of head injury.

4746|7651|1715225P50S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|VA treatment records also indicated that the Veteran endorsed symptoms of PTSD and received positive PTSD screenings.
4747|7653|1715225P50S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"For example, the Veteran reported during a June 2011 evaluation for Parkinson's disease that ""he is being worked up for PTSD related to Vietnam War service,"" referring to a December 28, 2010, PTSD screening."
4748|7655|1715225P50S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|A May 2011 VA emergency care record noted a diagnosis of PTSD, by a physician assistant.

4750|7659|1715225P51S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|In July 2010, the Veteran underwent VA examination.
4751|7662|1715225P51S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner diagnosed him with ""mood disorder NOS [(not otherwise specified)]"" and ""cognitive disorder NOS,"" but opined that it is less likely than not that the appellant's psychiatric conditions were ""solely due to military service."""
4752|7665|1715225P51S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner explained that given the Veteran's active duty only during April 1968, ""[d]epression or excessive worry"" and ""nervous trouble of any sort"" appears to have been endorsed on the June 1967 pre-induction exam."
4753|7667|1715225P51S4|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Also, the April 10, 1968, service treatment record documented a diagnosis emotional instability reaction and recommended discharge.
4754|7669|1715225P51S5|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|As such, the examiner found that it appears less likely as not that the Veteran's current conditions are solely due to his military service.
4755|7671|1715225P52S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The July 2010 VA examiner further stated she was unable to opine whether the psychiatric condition was aggravated by service without resort to mere speculation.
4756|7673|1715225P52S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"She explained that ""there is not enough information to make this determination,"" noting that the ""veteran reported . . . [a] motorcycle accident with reported head injury in 197[1], recent health problems, and psychosocial stressors which would complicate the determination of aggravation of symptoms (if any) secondary to service alone."""
4757|7675|1715225P53S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 2014, the Veteran underwent another VA examination.
4758|7677|1715225P53S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner concluded that the Veteran did not have a current diagnosis of PTSD, and that although some of his stressors were verified, his total symptomatology failed to meet the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth and fifth editions (DSM-IV and DSM-5).
4759|7679|1715225P53S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with a major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified; other specified trauma and stressor related disorder; major depressive disorder, recurrent, mild, with mild anxious distress; and unspecified personality disorder.
4760|7681|1715225P53S4|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner did not relate any of the disorders to service.
4761|7683|1715225P54S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"The March 2014 VA examiner opined that the neurocognitive disorder ""can be more appropriately related to a motorcycle accident that occurred in 1971."""
4762|7685|1715225P54S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA examiner further opined that the other specified stressor or trauma related disorder was etiologically rooted in experiences in the Merchant Marine and that the Veteran's major depressive disorder ""clearly pre-existed"" service."
4763|7687|1715225P54S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained by referencing the Veteran's pre-induction report of medical history and April 1968 acknowledgment that his symptoms dated to his adolescence.
4764|7689|1715225P54S4|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, the examiner opined that the Veteran's personality disorder began during adolescence and continued through adulthood.
4765|7691|1715225P55S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding aggravation, the examiner wrote:
4766|7693|1715225P56S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"With respect to ""aggravation"" the referral is not clear in its request."
4767|7695|1715225P56S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Almost all psychiatric disorders can be temporarily aggravated by significant stressors/life difficulties.
4768|7697|1715225P56S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|His induction into the Army against his will (being drafted while wishing certainly qualifies as such a stressor).
4769|7699|1715225P56S4|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|During this  brief time period, one would expect to see a worsening of his pre-existing symptoms; and such appears to have occurred.
4770|7701|1715225P56S5|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|However, this does not represent a permanent aggravation of expected course of the underlying/pre-existing condition.
4771|7703|1715225P56S6|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Again, such a response to a significant stressor would be expected given such a diagnostic presentation.
4772|7705|1715225P56S7|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|There is no convincing data to suggest that his diagnosis was permanently aggravated beyond normal expected course as a result of his 29 days of service.
4773|7707|1715225P56S8|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|As such, due to this writer not being able to discern the nature of the aggravation query the following two opinions are offered.
4774|7709|1715225P56S9|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|It is as likely as not that his Other Specified Stressor or Trauma Related Disorder[, Major Depressive Disorder, Recurrent, Mild, With Mild Anxious Distress, and Unspecified Personality Disorder] w[ere] temporarily aggravated during the time he was in military service (as a result of the stressors he experienced there).
4775|7711|1715225P56S10|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|However, it is less likely than not that this represents a permanent worsening or aggravation of th[ese] disorder[s].
4776|7713|1715225P56S11|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Instead, the course of his illness does not appear to have been markedly [a]ffected in a permanent or unexpected manner over his life-span as a result of his 29 days of service.
4777|7714|1715225P64S1|1715225|False|Sentence|E.  PTSD Claim
4778|7716|1715225P65S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that he currently has PTSD, which he associates with Vietnam service.
4779|7717|1715225P66S1|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board notes that any Vietnam service the Veteran may have had was with the Merchant Marines.
4780|7718|1715225P66S2|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|As discussed above, Merchant Marine service does not qualify as active duty for VA purposes, including for the establishment of service connection.
4781|7719|1715225P67S1|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection for PTSD requires medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with 38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a); a link, established by medical evidence, between current symptoms and an in-service stressor; and credible supporting evidence that the in-service stressor occurred.
4782|7720|1715225P67S2|1715225|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
4783|7721|1715225P68S1|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|"During the course of this appeal, 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) was revised to read ""If a stressor claimed by a Veteran is related to the Veteran's fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of [PTSD] and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed stressor, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places, types, and circumstances of the Veteran's service, the Veteran's lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed in-service stressor."""
4784|7722|1715225P68S2|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Given that the Veteran served less than a month, and only within the continental United States, the revision does not apply to the Veteran's claim.
4785|7724|1715225P69S1|1715225|False|FindingSentence|In this case, the Veteran has not met the first essential criterion for service connection for PTSD-medical diagnosis of the disorder in accordance with the applicable diagnostic criteria.
4786|7725|1715225P70S1|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|38 C.F.R. § 4.125(a) provides that all psychiatric diagnoses must conform to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
4787|7726|1715225P70S2|1715225|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
4788|7727|1715225P70S3|1715225|False|Sentence|"However, effective August 4, 2014, VA amended the portion of its Schedule for Rating Disabilities dealing with mental disorders and its adjudication regulations that define the term ""psychosis"" to remove outdated references to the DSM-IV and replace them with references to the recently updated DSM-V."
4789|7728|1715225P70S4|1715225|False|CitationSentence|See 79 Fed. Reg. 45, 094 (August 4, 2014).
4790|7729|1715225P70S5|1715225|False|Sentence|VA adopted as final, without change, this interim rule and clarified that the provisions of this interim final rule do not apply to claims that have been certified for appeal to the Board or are pending before the Board on or before August 4, 2014.
4791|7730|1715225P70S6|1715225|False|CitationSentence|See Schedule for Rating Disabilities - Mental Disorders and Definition of Psychosis for VA Purposes, 80 Fed. Reg. 14,308 (March 19, 2015).
4792|7732|1715225P70S7|1715225|False|FindingSentence|As the Veteran's claim had been certified to the Board prior to August 4, 2014, the previous version of 38 C.F.R. § 4.125 conforming to the DSM-IV is applicable in the present case.
4793|7735|1715225P71S1|1715225|False|FindingSentence|Considering the pertinent evidence in light of the above, the Board finds that the weight of the competent, persuasive medical evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have, and has not at any point during this appeal had, PTSD.
4794|7736|1715225P72S1|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's service treatment records, are negative for a finding or diagnosis of PTSD.
4795|7738|1715225P73S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|There are some positive PTSD screens of record.
4796|7740|1715225P73S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|At most, the Veteran has received a diagnosis of PTSD by non-mental health professionals, such as from a primary care physician (December 2010 VA medical record) and a physician assistant (May 2011 VA medical record).
4797|7741|1715225P73S3|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Such medical professionals are not mental health professionals and did not indicate how they reached such a conclusion.
4798|7742|1715225P73S4|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board further notes that the Veteran has a history of providing inaccurate information to such VA medical providers.
4799|7744|1715225P73S5|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, when discussing his medical history with the December 2010 VA primary care physician, the Veteran also claimed that he had a history of traumatic brain injury with a motorcycle accident while in the line of duty in November 1969.
4800|7746|1715225P73S6|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|SSA records clearly show that the Veteran's motorcycle accident occurred years after service, in 1971.

4802|7749|1715225P74S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA medical records, by mental health professionals, however, make clear that the Veteran does not have a DSM-IV or V diagnosis of PTSD.
4803|7751|1715225P74S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the VA examiner specifically found no diagnosis of PTSD.
4804|7753|1715225P74S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Indeed, the March 2014 VA examiner also specifically found that the Veteran failed to meet the criteria for either DSM-IV or DSM-V.
4805|7754|1715225P75S1|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, even if, for the sake of argument, the Board were to accept a diagnosis of PTSD, by a non-mental health care professional, the Veteran has not provided any stressor information for VA verification purposes.
4806|7755|1715225P75S2|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|At most, he has provided information regarding his pre-Army service with the Merchant Marines, which VA has made clear cannot be used for service connection purposes.
4807|7756|1715225P75S3|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Furthermore, even if he may have reported fear of hostile military or terrorist activity from such Merchant Marine service, and VA were to consider it as active duty (which it does not), service connection on that basis cannot be granted unless a diagnosis of PTSD is made by a VA psychiatrist or psychologist, or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom VA has contracted, who has confirmed that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD and that the Veteran's symptoms are related to the claimed disorder.
4808|7757|1715225P75S4|1715225|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
4809|7759|1715225P75S5|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the VA psychiatrists repeatedly found that the Veteran had psychiatric disorders other than PTSD.
4810|7760|1715225P75S6|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|In contrast, the VA primary care physician and physician assistant were not a psychiatrist or psychologist, as such any PTSD diagnosis made by such a provider would not be consistent with the requirements of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
4811|7761|1715225P76S1|1715225|False|Sentence|The Board acknowledges the Veteran's contention that he has a diagnosis of PTSD.
4812|7762|1715225P77S1|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the diagnosis of a psychiatric disability - specifically PTSD, falls outside the realm of common knowledge of a lay person, though lay persons are competent to provide opinions on some medical issues.
4813|7763|1715225P77S2|1715225|False|CitationSentence|See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App.  428, 435 (2011), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F.3d 1372, 1377 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (lay persons not competent to diagnose cancer); see also Woehlaert v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 456 (2007) (although the claimant is competent in certain situations to provide a diagnosis of a simple condition such as a broken leg or varicose veins, the claimant is not competent to provide evidence as to more complex medical questions).
4814|7764|1715225P77S3|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|As discussed above, specific criteria must be met for such a diagnosis and the Veteran has not claimed to have the medical knowledge necessary to make such a diagnosis.
4815|7766|1715225P78S1|1715225|False|FindingSentence|In short, the competent, probative evidence simply does not support finding that the Veteran has, in fact, been diagnosed with PTSD at any time during this appeal.
4816|7768|1715225P78S2|1715225|False|FindingSentence|In fact, the collective medical evidence indicates that the Veteran does not have PTSD.
4817|7769|1715225P79S1|1715225|False|Sentence|As the first, essential criterion for service connection for PTSD-a current medical diagnosis of the disorder in accordance with the DSM-IV-is not met, service connection for PTSD cannot be established, the Board need not address the remaining criteria for service connection for PTSD.
4818|7770|1715225P79S2|1715225|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
4819|7772|1715225P80S1|1715225|False|FindingSentence|For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for PTSD must be denied.
4820|7773|1715225P80S2|1715225|False|Sentence|In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.
4821|7776|1715225P80S3|1715225|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.

4825|7782|1715225P82S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran does not have a diagnosis of PTSD, during the appeal period, VA psychiatrists have repeatedly diagnosed the Veteran with other acquired psychiatric disorders, to include (i) major neurocognitive disorder, unspecified; (ii) other specified trauma and stressor related disorder; (iii) major depressive disorder, recurrent, mild, with mild anxious distress; and (iv) unspecified personality disorder (discussed above), but the examiner did not relate any of the disorders to service (March 2014 VA examination).
4826|7784|1715225P83S1|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The most probative evidence of record to address the question of etiology of psychiatric disorders and the aggravation for any pre-existing psychiatric disorder is the March 2014 VA examination.

4831|7789|1715225P83S6|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the March 2014 VA examination is the most probative evidence of record, as the medical opinion included the most complete review available evidence, including the claims file and more recent medical records than those associated with the prior VA examination.
4832|7790|1715225P83S7|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Furthermore, the March 2014 VA examiner provided the most thorough and detailed opinion.
4833|7792|1715225P84S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|"The March 2014 VA examiner opined that the neurocognitive disorder ""can be more appropriately related to a motorcycle accident that occurred in 1971 [post-service]."""
4834|7794|1715225P84S2|1715225|False|FindingSentence|As such, service connection for either a neurocognitive disorder is denied on a direct basis and did not pre-exist service.

4857|7821|1715225P90S1|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Given that the Veteran's June 1967 pre-induction examination documented a normal clinical psychiatric evaluation, the presumption of soundness would generally apply to the Veteran.
4858|7825|1715225P90S2|1715225|False|FindingSentence|However, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness is rebutted, as there is clear and unmistakable evidence both that the depression and other specified stressor or trauma related disorder existed prior to service and were not aggravated by service.
4859|7826|1715225P90S3|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|"Clear and unmistakable evidence of a pre-existing psychiatric disorder includes consideration of the June 1967 report of medical history, the appellant reported a history of ""depression or excessive worry"" and ""nervous trouble of any sort,"" and the examiner's notation that the Veteran had ""nervous and worries"" occasionally."

4863|7836|1715225P90S7|1715225|False|FindingSentence|Taken together, the Board finds that the most probative evidence of record is clear and unmistakable in showing that the Veteran had a psychiatric disorder that pre-existed service.

4865|7839|1715225P91S1|1715225|False|Sentence|The Board must now consider whether the Veteran's pre-existing psychiatric disorders were aggravated by service.
4866|7841|1715225P92S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The March 2014 VA examiner specifically found that regarding the pre-existing psychiatric disorders, almost all psychiatric disorders can be temporarily aggravated by significant stressors/life difficulties, such as the Veteran being drafted.
4867|7843|1715225P92S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|She explained that during the Veteran's brief (29 days) time period, one would expect to see a worsening of his pre-existing symptoms; and such appears to have occurred.
4868|7845|1715225P92S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|However, she determined that such worsening did not represent a permanent aggravation of expected course of the underlying/pre-existing condition.
4869|7847|1715225P92S4|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|She found no convincing data to suggest that his diagnosis was permanently aggravated beyond normal expected course as a result of his 29 days of service.
4870|7849|1715225P92S5|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|As such, the examiner found that the pre-existing disorders were only temporarily aggravated during the time he was in military service (as a result of the stressors he experienced there).
4871|7851|1715225P92S6|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Again, she found that it did not represent a permanent worsening or aggravation of these disorders.

4874|7856|1715225P92S9|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds this opinion of significant probative value as it includes a detailed rationale and is consistent with the evidence of record.
4875|7858|1715225P93S1|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The March 2014 VA examiner effectively found that there was no permanent aggravation of the pre-existing psychiatric disorder, though there was a temporary aggravation/flare-up.
4876|7859|1715225P93S2|1715225|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Federal Circuit has held that evidence of temporary flare-ups symptomatic of an underlying  preexisting condition, alone, is not sufficient for a non-combat veteran to show increased disability under 38 U.S.C. § 1153 unless the underlying condition is worsened.

4879|7864|1715225P94S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The first actual diagnosis of major medical depression was an October 1999 private medical provider finding that the Veteran has a history of depression contrary to his non-service-connected general medical condition.
4880|7866|1715225P94S3|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|Indeed, in a December 2010 VA medical record, the Veteran himself dated the onset of his depression after the motorcycle accident (which occurred after service) and resulted in major residual physical problems.
4881|7869|1715225P94S4|1715225|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds that there is clear and unmistakable evidence that the Veteran's pre-existing major medical depression was not permanent aggravated by his 29 days of service.

4884|7875|1715225P95S3|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|As the Board has found the March 2014 VA examination to be the most probative medical evidence of record, it defers to the March 2014 VA examiner's diagnoses.
4885|7876|1715225P95S4|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board further notes that under 38 C.F.R. § 4.130, based on the DSM-IV, the category of mood disorders encompasses the diagnosis found by the March 2014 VA examiner of depressive disorder/depression.

4887|7879|1715225P96S2|1715225|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner noted that the Veteran has carried multiple diagnoses and noted consideration of the his prior psychiatric medications and treatment.

4891|7893|1715225P96S6|1715225|False|FindingSentence|As the Board has found the March 2014 VA examination to be the most probative medical evidence of record, and the VA examiner did not find such disorder to be present diagnostically or to have been present in service, the Board finds that service connection for such a disorder is not warranted.
4892|7894|1715225P96S7|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board further notes, in passing, that such a diagnosis was not of record in service or until decades after service.
4893|7895|1715225P96S8|1715225|False|ReasoningSentence|Even if, for the sake of argument, such a disorder had been diagnosed shortly after service, the Veteran served less than 90 days.

4897|7901|1715225P97S1|1715225|False|FindingSentence|As such, the weight of the medical evidence supports the conclusion that any current psychiatric disability, to include depression, is not related to service.
4898|7903|1715225P97S2|1715225|False|FindingSentence|For all the foregoing reasons, the Board finds that the claim for service connection for psychiatric disability, to include PTSD and depression, must be denied.
4899|7904|1715225P97S3|1715225|False|Sentence|In reaching this conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit-of-the-doubt doctrine.

4923|7937|1716934P49S2|1716934|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus the provisions of 38 U.S.C.A. § 1154 (b) (2014) and 38 C.F.R. § 3.304 (f)(2), (3) (2016) do not apply.

5190|8350|1631836P49S6|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner wrote that she could not state that the Veteran had experienced military sexual trauma, as she had ""clearly stated that her physician had refused to relieve her of any military duties, and that ""requesting a soldier who is subordinate in rank to complete their designated assignment is a duty and does not constitute sexual harassment-or in fact, any form of harassment."""

5198|8368|1631836P50S6|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner diagnosed the Veteran with MDD and anxiety, and stated that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD, as she did not have an adequate stressor and her reported symptoms of difficulty sleeping, social isolation, and inability to focus were due to her depression.
5199|8371|1631836P50S7|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was less likely as not a result of service, explaining that the Veteran had reported that her depression and anxiety symptoms were related to her dependent son's physical condition and her deceased son's murder.

5203|8380|1631836P52S1|1631836|False|FindingSentence|The Board has carefully reviewed the medical records outlined above, but finds that the weight of the evidence is against finding that the Veteran's current psychiatric diagnoses had their onset during or are related to her military service.
5204|8382|1631836P53S1|1631836|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record does establish that the Veteran has a current psychiatric disability, which has been variously diagnosed as PTSD, MDD, anxiety disorder, and adjustment disorder.
5205|8384|1631836P53S2|1631836|False|FindingSentence|She has thus met the current disability requirement.
5206|8386|1631836P54S1|1631836|False|FindingSentence|The evidence does not show, however, that she incurred a psychiatric disorder during her active service, or that her current diagnosis is related to her active service.
5207|8388|1631836P54S2|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's active duty period of service is from December 1981 to May 1982.
5208|8390|1631836P54S3|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran herself has not indicated that any traumatic event occurred to her at this time, or that her psychiatric problems had their onset at this time.
5209|8392|1631836P54S4|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|Rather, the Veteran asserts that her psychiatric disorder is related to negative experiences which occurred during her service in the National Guard.
5210|8393|1631836P55S1|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board accepts that the Veteran had additional periods of INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA in the years following her separation from active duty in 1982, and that the events that she has described involving a disagreement with her superior officer over his refusal to grant her leave due to her pregnancy and the birth of her child occurred as she described, and that they likely occurred during a period of ACDUTRA.
5211|8394|1631836P55S2|1631836|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 101(24), 106.
5212|8396|1631836P55S3|1631836|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, the overwhelming weight of the evidence indicates that the Veteran's current psychiatric disorders are not related to any event that occurred during her military service, but are instead attributed to the numerous, severe personal stressors in her life post-service, including the murder of her son and caring for her disabled son R.
5213|8397|1631836P56S1|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran is competent to testify regarding her experiences of having a conflict with her superior officer in service and of seeing the possible remains of a fellow service member who committed suicide.

5215|8399|1631836P56S3|1631836|False|LegalRuleSentence|Lay witnesses are also competent to opine on some questions of etiology, and the Board must determine on a case-by-case basis whether a particular condition is the type of condition that is within the competence of a lay person.

5217|8401|1631836P56S5|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The question of whether the Veteran's current psychiatric disorder is related to her in-service experiences is testimony as to an internal psychiatric process, unlike the immediately observable cause-and-effect relationship of the type as to which the courts have found lay evidence to be competent.
5218|8402|1631836P56S6|1631836|False|CitationSentence|"Compare Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, 6 (2009) (""It is generally the province of medical professionals to diagnose or label a mental condition, not the claimant"") with Jandreau, 492 F.3d at 1376 (lay witness capable of diagnosing dislocated shoulder); Falzone v. Brown, 8 Vet. App. 398, 403 (1995) (lay person competent to testify to pain and visible flatness of his feet)."
5219|8403|1631836P56S7|1631836|False|LegalRuleSentence|Diagnosing a psychiatric disability is a complex medical matter; determining whether a person's symptoms are merely the type of feelings that accompany the stress and worry that would normally accompany such unfortunate events, or whether these symptoms rise to the severity and frequency that would warrant a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder requires psychiatric or psychological training.
5220|8404|1631836P56S8|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran has not been shown to have the appropriate medical training and expertise to opine on this question, and her testimony in this regard is therefore not competent.
5221|8405|1631836P57S1|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|As to the medical evidence, the Board finds that it weighs against a nexus between any current psychiatric disability and service.
5222|8407|1631836P57S2|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's private treatment records show that she received counseling for problems related to caring for her disabled son, the death of her parents and other son, and sexual trauma in her adolescence.
5223|8410|1631836P57S3|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|Her April 2006 disability evaluation found that the Veteran's disorder was caused by the loss of her family members, and at her November 2004 Social Services evaluation, she reported many life stressors that led to her intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks, but these did not include any event in service.
5224|8412|1631836P57S4|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's VA psychiatric evaluation found that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder was not a result of service, and that they were instead due to her dependent son's physical condition and her deceased son's murder.
5225|8413|1631836P57S5|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|As the examiner explained the reasons for his conclusions based on an accurate characterization of the evidence of record, this opinion is entitled to substantial probative weight.
5226|8414|1631836P57S6|1631836|False|CitationSentence|See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295, 304 (2008).
5227|8415|1631836P57S7|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|Furthermore, there are no conflicting medical opinions of record which contradict the findings of the VA examiner, and in fact her findings are fully consistent with the other medical evidence of record.
5228|8418|1631836P58S1|1631836|False|FindingSentence|While the Board sympathizes with the Veteran's contention that her son's disability was in some way caused by either stress from arguing with her superior officer or physical strain from serving on ACDUTRA while she was pregnant, the evidence of record does not support this contention.
5229|8421|1631836P58S2|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|The medical records of the Veteran's son R. do show that he has a serious disability which requires constant care, but treatment records from 1986 and 1987 show that he had encephalopathy of unclear origin precipitated by tonsillitis and a fever.
5230|8422|1631836P58S3|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran herself seems unsure of the cause of her son's illness, as her statements made prior to filing the current claim show that she believed the illness was caused by an adverse reaction to a vaccination.
5231|8423|1631836P58S4|1631836|False|LegalRuleSentence|The credibility of a witness can be impeached by a showing of interest, bias, inconsistent statements, or, to a certain extent, bad character.

5233|8425|1631836P58S6|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the Veteran's assertions are both inconsistent and lacking in probative value due to the Veteran's lack of medical training or expertise to allow her to form a medical judgment regarding the cause of her son's illness.
5234|8428|1631836P58S7|1631836|False|FindingSentence|The Board finds no competent medical evidence linking the Veteran's son's illness to her military service, and no indication that the Veteran's post-service life stressors, which have clearly been shown to be the cause of her current psychiatric disorder, are related to her service in any way.
5235|8429|1631836P59S1|1631836|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board also acknowledges that there are special provisions pertaining to corroboration of PTSD based on personal assault in service.

5237|8432|1631836P59S3|1631836|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran has indicated that she believes her harassment in service should constitute ""sexual harassment."""
5238|8433|1631836P59S4|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's assertions are accepted at face value regarding being denied leave from service for her pregnancy and/or following the birth of her child, but such conduct does not constitute sexual harassment or military sexual trauma, and as such, the provisions of 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f) are not applicable in this case.
5239|8434|1631836P59S5|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|"This is manifestly evident to the Board based on the Veteran's own testimony, and is further indicated by the Veteran's May 2011 VA intake evaluation, at which the examiner found that the Veteran had clearly stated that her complaint was that she was not relieved from duty when she felt she should be, and this ""does not constitute sexus harassment-or in fact, any form of harassment."""
5240|8435|1631836P60S1|1631836|False|ReasoningSentence|Finally, the Board notes that at no time has the Veteran been shown to have a diagnosis of psychosis, and thus consideration of whether the presumptions afforded for a chronic disease is not warranted at this time, nor are such presumptions applicable to periods of INACDUTRA and ACDUTRA.
5241|8436|1631836P60S2|1631836|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. §§ 1112, 1113, 1137 (West 2014); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.307, 3.309 (2015); Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 46-47 (2010).
5242|8439|1631836P61S1|1631836|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the weight of the competent and probative evidence of record therefore fails to establish that the Veteran's psychiatric disorder had its onset during active duty service or any period of INACDUTRA or ACDUTRA, nor is it related to any event during service.
5243|8441|1631836P61S2|1631836|False|FindingSentence|The preponderance of the evidence is thus against the claim for entitlement to service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, MDD, and anxiety.
5244|8442|1631836P61S3|1631836|False|Sentence|In reaching the conclusion above the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
5245|8445|1631836P61S4|1631836|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the claim, that doctrine is not applicable.

5250|8453|1525217P19S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|2. A current psychiatric condition, variously diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and PTSD, is shown as likely as not to have been manifested during service when the Veteran was treated for depression in December 1983.

5301|8513|1525217P39S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|Next, the evidence of record makes at least equally likely that the Veteran manifested symptoms of his condition during service.
5302|8515|1525217P39S2|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|"His service treatment records (STRs) affirmatively show treatment in December 1983 for ""[m]ild depression"" associated with his expectation that his father would ""die [at] any time [and he] worries about this."""
5303|8517|1525217P40S1|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran has also alleged MST during service.
5304|8520|1525217P40S2|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|The RO determined in an October 2010 statement of the case (SOC) that the Veteran likely experienced MST, as he claimed.
5305|8521|1525217P40S3|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|The RO's finding does not follow from the evidence it cited, and its finding is not a binding determination at this point in time.

5307|8524|1525217P40S5|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|The RO based its finding on an entry in the STRs showing that the Veteran received treatment at Fort Hood, Texas, in May 1985 for lesions on the penis with last sexual contact one week prior.
5308|8525|1525217P40S6|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board notes that this treatment was received two years after the last claimed trauma (the second of two), which the Veteran states occurred in 1983.
5309|8526|1525217P40S7|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, this treatment could not possibly have been for the alleged 1983 trauma, which would have occurred outside the one-week window identified in the treatment record.
5310|8527|1525217P40S8|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Also, the treatment occurred in Texas, rather than Germany, and he had transferred out of Germany in August 1983, which would again place it outside of the one-week timeframe.
5311|8528|1525217P41S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Nonetheless, the December 1983 treatment for depression establishes (a) treatment for a mental health condition during service (depression), and (b) a stressful event (the impending death of his father).
5312|8529|1525217P42S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|There is some indication in the evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric condition may have manifested prior to service.
5313|8532|1525217P42S2|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|As best summarized by a VA examiner in September 2011, the Veteran has reported at various times that he experienced traumatic events as a child.
5314|8534|1525217P43S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|"For purposes of this appeal, a mental health condition was not ""noted"" at service entrance."

5341|8567|1525217P49S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|There is not clear and unmistakable evidence establishing the preexistence of a psychiatric condition.
5342|8568|1525217P49S2|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|First, there is no contemporaneous evidence prior to service.
5343|8569|1525217P49S3|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, there is only circumstantial evidence indicating a preexisting psychiatric condition.

5345|8572|1525217P49S5|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|This would indicate that the Veteran's pre-service trauma contributed to the onset of psychiatric condition.
5346|8574|1525217P50S1|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a VA examiner reviewed the matter in July 2010 and again in September 2011.

5348|8578|1525217P50S3|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|In the Rationale section of the report, the VA examiner restated this opinion: The [V]eteran's (PTSD . . . ) which existed prior to service. . . .
5349|8579|1525217P50S4|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|These types of definitive statements could support a finding that the condition preexisted service.
5350|8580|1525217P51S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the VA examiner's September 2011 opinion is quite equivocal when read in its entirety.
5351|8582|1525217P51S2|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|First, the VA examiner started off by reiterating prior evidence, which he found to undermine the Veteran's credibility as a historian (relating the fact of preexisting trauma).
5352|8584|1525217P51S3|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|"Then, the examiner declared that ""[a] mental disorder may have pre-existed military service."" (Emphasis added.)"
5353|8585|1525217P51S4|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Such an equivocal medical opinion, especially where it is based on the VA examiner's own assessment that the factual predicate was unreliable, does not meet VA's clear and unmistakable burden of proof.

5355|8587|1525217P52S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|There is otherwise no clear and unmistakable evidence establishing a preexisting traumatic injury.
5356|8589|1525217P53S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|There is also no clear and unmistakable evidence establishing that his psychiatric condition, if preexisting, was not aggravated during service.

5360|8595|1525217P53S5|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board notes, as an initial matter, that this is a compound conclusion.
5361|8596|1525217P53S6|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|It could mean either (a) there was no aggravation by service and, therefore, no natural progression, or (b) that there was aggravation by service, but not one beyond the natural progression.
5362|8597|1525217P53S7|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|In either event, the VA went on to make remarks which undermine the conclusiveness of his opinion.
5363|8599|1525217P53S8|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|"For instance, under bullet point number 4, he indicated that ""[s]ubstance abuse may have been [an] aggravating factor."""
5364|8600|1525217P53S9|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|When read most favorably for the Veteran, the examiner's statement tends to suggest that the examiner did find a degree of aggravation during service.
5365|8602|1525217P53S10|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|"Also notable, the VA examiner stated in bullet number 5 that ""[o]ther service record evidence tends to contraindicate a severe impairment at that time."""
5366|8604|1525217P53S11|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|"(The examiner had already stated his opinion that the Veteran ""may have . . . already experience severe childhood"" trauma.)"
5367|8605|1525217P53S12|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|This might indicate that the VA examiner found the preexisting diagnosis to have lessened in severity during service.
5368|8606|1525217P53S13|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|"However, the examiner's use of the qualifiers ""tends"" and ""contraindicate"" suggest that this conclusion was not undebatable."
5369|8607|1525217P54S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|All of this evidence, including the VA examiner's conclusions, greatly increases the likelihood that a preexisting psychiatric condition was not aggravated by service.
5370|8608|1525217P54S2|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|However, this evidence does not make it clear and unmistakable.
5371|8610|1525217P54S3|1525217|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not rebutted.
5372|8611|1525217P54S4|1525217|False|CitationSentence|See 38 U.S.C.A. § 1111; Horn, 25 Vet. App. 231.
5373|8614|1525217P55S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|Because the Veteran is presumed sound at service entrance, and because the presumption of soundness is not rebutted, the psychiatric condition that manifested in service is deemed service-incurred.

5377|8618|1525217P58S1|1525217|False|LegalRuleSentence|Even if an injury or disease is deemed to have been incurred in service pursuant to application of the presumption of soundness (or to have been found to have been actually incurred in service), a veteran must nonetheless establish that a current disability is related to the in-service injury or disease.

5387|8632|1525217P59S4|1525217|False|EvidenceSentence|(The same VA examiner offered similar reasoning in the September 2011 examination report.)
5388|8633|1525217P60S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|It is implicit in the VA examiner's rationale that the Veteran's psychiatric symptomatology during service was a continuation of a preexisting mental health condition.
5389|8634|1525217P60S2|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Otherwise, the rationale offered cannot be reconciled with the opinion given.
5390|8635|1525217P60S3|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the VA examiner's opinion must be interpreted to mean that the in-service depression was a manifestation of the preexisting condition.
5391|8638|1525217P60S4|1525217|False|FindingSentence|By operation of the presumption of soundness, as explained herein above, the Veteran's psychiatric symptoms, even if actually preexisting service, must be deemed to have been service-incurred.

5393|8640|1525217P60S6|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, this VA examiner's opinion is essentially positive nexus evidence.
5394|8641|1525217P61S1|1525217|False|ReasoningSentence|There otherwise appears to be no material dispute that the Veteran's current psychiatric condition is a continuation of the symptoms deemed to have first manifested during service.
5395|8643|1525217P62S1|1525217|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the evidence is in relative equipoise in making it likely that the Veteran's current mental health condition manifested during or was incurred in service.

5516|8847|1316336P34S7|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner indicated that although the Veteran endorsed several symptoms of PTSD, it was not diagnosed for several reasons.
5517|8849|1316336P34S8|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|"First, the examiner explained that the overall level of traumatic exposure appeared ""very low:"" the history of seeing dead bodies was not significantly deviant from many people's common experience, where people see dead bodies in a hospital setting or funeral and the Veteran did not describe feeling in danger for his own life during the experience."
5518|8853|1316336P34S9|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|Second, the examiner explained, the level of symptom reporting seemed rather severe given the level of traumatic exposure: the Veteran reported that all his symptoms worsened significantly or started after seeing the bodies, explaining that he could no longer get along with others and had difficulty interacting, but the Veteran denied any disciplinary problems or performance problems for the remainder of service.
5519|8856|1316336P34S10|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|Finally, the examiner explained, multiple treatment records reflected concern of over-reporting and over-endorsing which, when included with the above information, made the examining unable to accurately diagnose PTSD.
5520|8860|1316336P34S11|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that VA inpatient records did not reflect a primary diagnosis of PTSD and reflected a finding that the PTSD symptoms likely had minimal contribution to the Veteran's current symptom state.

5556|8938|1316336P39S6|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner found it was less likely as not that this stressor occurred; thus, the examiner did not consider this stressor when determining whether the Veteran had PTSD.

5569|8970|1316336P41S2|1316336|False|FindingSentence|Initially, the Board finds that service connection is not warranted for PTSD.
5570|8973|1316336P41S3|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board acknowledges that the record includes diagnoses of PTSD.
5571|8974|1316336P41S4|1316336|False|ReasoningSentence|The records reflecting diagnoses of PTSD do not reveal an explanation as to how the Veteran met the criteria for PTSD, however; as such, the Board finds the diagnoses have limited probative value.

5573|8976|1316336P41S6|1316336|False|ReasoningSentence|In contrast, the Board finds the VA examiners' and other medical professionals' determinations that the Veteran does not have PTSD are highly probative as the determinations are supported by detailed explanation for why the diagnosis was not proper and are based on findings consistent with the medical records.
5574|8977|1316336P41S7|1316336|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the probative value of the findings of no PTSD outweighs the probative value of the findings of PTSD.
5575|8979|1316336P41S8|1316336|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds the Veteran does not have PTSD.
5576|8981|1316336P42S1|1316336|False|FindingSentence|Service connection is also not warranted for a psychiatric disability other than PTSD.
5577|8983|1316336P42S2|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board acknowledges that the probative evidence indicates that the Veteran has a mood disorder.
5578|8985|1316336P42S3|1316336|False|FindingSentence|The probative evidence does not indicate that the mood disorder began during, was aggravated by, or is causally related to military service, however.
5579|8987|1316336P43S1|1316336|False|FindingSentence|Initially, the Board finds the psychiatric disability did not begin during service.
5580|8988|1316336P43S2|1316336|False|ReasoningSentence|The service medical records reflect no diagnosis of a psychiatric disability, the service personnel records reflect no notations suggestive of a behavioral change due to psychiatric symptoms, the first diagnosis of a psychiatric disability dates more than eight years after separation from military service, and VA examiners have provided opinions indicating that the current psychiatric disability did not begin during service: although the examiners did not explicitly make that determination, the Board finds the determinations that the condition preexisted service are de facto determinations that the condition did not begin during service.
5581|8991|1316336P43S3|1316336|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has reported that his psychiatric symptoms began during service.
5582|8992|1316336P43S4|1316336|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran is competent to report that his psychiatric symptoms began during service, the Board finds any such history is not credible in light of the varied and conflicting histories of record as to the date of onset of the psychiatric symptoms.

5596|9015|1316336P45S3|1316336|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the Board finds a psychiatric disability did not manifest during military service, and the presumption of soundness does not apply.

5717|9157|1713743P121S1|1713743|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran's PTSD claim is predicated on an allegation of a physical assault while he was in the military.
5718|9158|1713743P121S2|1713743|False|ReasoningSentence|Because personal trauma is an extremely personal and sensitive issue, many incidents are not officially reported, which creates a proof problem with respect to the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
5719|9159|1713743P121S3|1713743|False|ReasoningSentence|In such situations, it is not unusual for there to be an absence of service records documenting the events the veteran has alleged.

5934|9485|1719263P60S6|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the perceptual experience in 1987 that the appellant described may have been a prodrome of schizophrenia; however, he did not seek any medical attention and there is no formal documentation about what was going on.
5935|9487|1719263P60S7|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|Based on the evidence of record, the examiner concluded that the appellant's schizophrenia first began when it was psychiatrically diagnosed in 1994.
5936|9488|1719263P60S8|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|This opinion is considered probative as the examiner reviewed the claims folder, considered relevant history and records, and provided sufficient rationale.
5937|9490|1719263P61S1|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|In November 2015, the appellant underwent an independent medical evaluation at a private neuropsychiatric clinic.
5938|9493|1719263P61S2|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician, Dr. M.M., indicated that he met with the appellant and reported reviewing the claimant's medical records and military personnel file.
5939|9496|1719263P61S3|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician noted that there was no documented history of psychiatric illness or treatment at the time of the appellant's enlistment examination on June 29, 1987.
5940|9499|1719263P61S4|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant provided information concerning the year 1987 and reported that the day before leaving for a period of training he had an experience and from that time forth it felt like everything that happened to him was backwards.
5941|9501|1719263P61S5|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|"The examiner stated that ""[t]his experience of things being 'backwards' was systemized, prevalent and continuous and constituted delusional thinking on the part of [the appellant] in a way that was bizarre and falls under the diagnostic criteria required for diagnosing 'Schizophrenia'."""
5942|9503|1719263P61S6|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|"Dr. M.M. stated that, ""[i]nexplicably, this experience of 'everything was backward' seemed to end around 1997."""
5943|9505|1719263P62S1|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding unauthorized absences from drills, the appellant explained that he presented for the training drills but was not able to sign in because he did not have a swipe card.
5944|9508|1719263P62S2|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician noted that while the appellant might not have made any complaint about psychiatric symptoms during Reserve service in no way establishes that he was not experiencing symptoms.
5945|9510|1719263P62S3|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician further noted that longitudinally speaking, the appellant was able to successfully enlist into the National Guard and then in the Army Reserve.
5946|9512|1719263P62S4|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequent to his enlistment in the Reserve, he developed symptoms and manifested a behavior disturbance consistent with schizophrenia.
5947|9514|1719263P62S5|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician set forth a detailed mental status examination indicating that the appellant was presently delusional.
5948|9516|1719263P62S6|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician proceeded to answer specific questions.
5949|9519|1719263P63S1|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|First, he opined that the appellant's current psychiatric illness was schizophrenia and that it first manifested while he was in the Army Reserve.
5950|9521|1719263P63S2|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|Second, he opined that the appellant's behavior disturbance that resulted in him being absent without leave developed and occurred after he successfully enlisted in the Reserve and in his opinion, and within a reasonable degree of medical probability, was due to schizophrenia, the onset of which occurred during his period of enlistment in the Army Reserve.
5951|9523|1719263P63S3|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|More likely than not the absence without leave marked the first manifestation of symptoms of his current schizophrenia.
5952|9524|1719263P64S1|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|As set forth, this evaluation indicates that the appellant's schizophrenia manifested sometime during his period of service in the Army Reserve (October 1987 to June 1993).
5953|9526|1719263P64S2|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|More specifically, the physician indicated the periods of absence without leave marked the first manifestations of symptoms.
5954|9527|1719263P64S3|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|The physician interviewed the appellant and reviewed relevant records and the opinion is considered probative.
5955|9528|1719263P65S1|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board acknowledges that on its face, this report appears to support the appellant's claim.
5956|9530|1719263P65S2|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|As discussed above, however, the appellant was in the Army Reserve and was not serving on active duty.
5957|9531|1719263P65S3|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|Even assuming the condition first manifested during the missed drills in 1990, the appellant was clearly absence without leave at that time and thus, not in either a period of active duty for training or inactive duty for training.
5958|9532|1719263P65S4|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|This report does not serve to establish entitlement to service connection.
5959|9533|1719263P66S1|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent the appellant asserts that he was actually present for the drills in question, the Board does not find his statements credible.
5960|9534|1719263P66S2|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, Dr. M.M. suggested this was part of his delusional thinking.
5961|9535|1719263P66S3|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, the official military records documenting the unexcused absences are considered far more probative than the appellant's statements in this regard.
5962|9536|1719263P67S1|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent the appellant may be alleging that a psychiatric disorder started while he was not on duty but was subsequently aggravated by military duty, the Board notes that where there is a claim based on a period of active duty for training or inactive duty for training, the presumption of aggravation is not applicable.
5963|9537|1719263P67S2|1719263|False|CitationSentence|See Smith v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 40, 48 n. 7 (2010).
5964|9541|1719263P67S3|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted above, service records show no treatment for a psychiatric disorder and the appellant himself has denied seeking treatment for a psychiatric disorder during service.
5965|9543|1719263P67S4|1719263|False|FindingSentence|Thus, service connection on the basis of aggravation must be denied.
5966|9544|1719263P68S1|1719263|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board also recognizes that where an appellant served continuously for 90 days or more during a period of war, or during peacetime service after December 31, 1946, and a psychosis becomes manifest to a degree of 10 percent within one year from the date of termination of such service, such disease shall be presumed to have been incurred or aggravated in service, even though there is no evidence of such disease during the period of service.

5968|9546|1719263P68S3|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|In this case, the appellant's only period of service lasting 90 days or more ended in April 1985.
5969|9547|1719263P68S4|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no medical evidence reflecting that any psychosis was compensably disabling within one year of April 1985.
5970|9548|1719263P68S5|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|Indeed, the appellant's own statements put the onset of symptoms in 1987, well outside the one year period.
5971|9549|1719263P68S6|1719263|False|LegalRuleSentence|It is also well to note that presumptive periods do not apply to periods of active duty for training and inactive duty for training.

5973|9552|1719263P68S8|1719263|False|FindingSentence|A psychiatric disorder cannot be presumed incurred during the appellant's service.
5974|9553|1719263P69S1|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board is cognizant that the criteria for establishing service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder are different from those for establishing service connection for other psychiatric disorders.
5975|9554|1719263P69S2|1719263|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. § 3.304(f).
5976|9556|1719263P69S3|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|In his May 2011 stressor statement, the appellant reported an incident occurring on January 15, 1989 at his house.
5977|9558|1719263P69S4|1719263|False|EvidenceSentence|He described the incident as when he realized that he needed to do things in reverse order.
5978|9561|1719263P69S5|1719263|False|FindingSentence|In this case, however, the appellant has not been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder and has not clearly articulated an in-service stressor that could have caused posttraumatic stress disorder.
5979|9562|1719263P69S6|1719263|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, as the appellant did not serve in combat any stressor must be verified, and here there is no evidence that independently corroborates any claimed stressor.

5981|9565|1719263P69S8|1719263|False|FindingSentence|Entitlement to service connection for posttraumatic stress disorder is not warranted.
5982|9568|1719263P70S1|1719263|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the most probative evidence preponderates against finding that the appellant's psychiatric disorder had its onset during a period of active duty for training or inactive duty for training and as no psychiatric disorder is otherwise related to any such period of service, the claim is denied.
5983|9571|1719263P71S1|1719263|False|FindingSentence|In reaching this decision the Board considered the doctrine of reasonable doubt, however, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the appellant's claim, the doctrine is not for application.

5996|9589|1718378P35S1|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran seeks entitlement to service connection an acquired psychiatric disorder, variously diagnosed as PTSD, depressive disorder, and anxiety disorder.
5997|9591|1718378P35S2|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, he contends his illness arose because he was almost pulled underneath a Bradley vehicle while serving at Fort Carson, Colorado, and in another incident, he was separated from the rest of his team when he fell several feet into a valley during a training exercise at the National Training Center (NTC) in Fort Irwin, California, and live rounds were fired in close proximity over his head.
5998|9592|1718378P36S1|1718378|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection may be granted if the evidence demonstrates that a current disability resulted from an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in active military service.
5999|9593|1718378P36S2|1718378|False|LegalRuleSentence|This means that the facts establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.

6001|9595|1718378P37S1|1718378|False|LegalRuleSentence|Generally, in order to prove service connection, there must be competent, credible evidence of (1) a current disability, (2) in-service incurrence or aggravation of an injury or disease, and (3) a nexus, or link, between the current disability and the in-service disease or injury.

6008|9603|1718378P38S6|1718378|False|FindingSentence|As the Veteran's diagnoses of record do not reflect psychoses, service connection on a presumptive basis as a chronic disease is not warranted.
6009|9604|1718378P39S1|1718378|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection for a disability may also be established based on aggravation of disease or injury which preexisted service when there is an increase in disability during service unless the increase is due to the natural progress of the disease.

6117|9782|1718378P74S4|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that although both claimed stressors come from plausible scenarios, there is no evidence in his military records or subsequent military records obtained by VA to confirm the events.
6118|9784|1718378P74S5|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|He concluded that as a result of over-endorsement of mental health difficulties and contradictions in the medical record, it was difficult to come to a precise determination of the etiology of his mental health condition.

6121|9792|1718378P74S8|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|There was significant evidence suggesting that mental health issues preceded his military service, and his private LCSW's treatment notes were unavailable for review.
6122|9794|1718378P75S1|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|All available records have been obtained; there exists no evidence corroborating the Veteran's claimed stressors.
6123|9795|1718378P75S2|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|Lay evidence alone is insufficient to establish that the incidents reported, occurred.
6124|9796|1718378P75S3|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|An opinion by a private clinician after the fact is not enough to prove a stressor occurred.
6125|9798|1718378P75S4|1718378|False|FindingSentence|These facts preclude a grant of service connection for PTSD.
6126|9799|1718378P76S1|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|As to the other psychiatric diagnoses, there is some evidence indicating a psychiatric condition may have preexisted service.
6127|9801|1718378P76S2|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|However, there are no pre-service medical records and no notation on his April 1995 entrance examination other than a reference to couples counseling.
6128|9803|1718378P76S3|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran himself has more recently denied any history of abuse or pre-service psychiatric conditions.
6129|9805|1718378P76S4|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, he did not choose to provide medical treatment records from the 1980s, from his treatment at Cape Cod, or from his private LCSW which might discuss the etiology of his condition.
6130|9807|1718378P76S5|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The April 2015 VA examiner opined that the most likely timeline of his mental health condition was development prior to military service.
6131|9813|1718378P76S6|1718378|False|FindingSentence|However, as noted above, there is no medical evidence; because no condition was noted at entrance and there is no evidence of a clear and unmistakable error to rebut the presumption of soundness, the Veteran is taken as sound at entry into service.
6132|9815|1718378P76S7|1718378|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, there can be no aggravation of a psychological condition in service.
6133|9816|1718378P76S8|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|A presentation of the condition during service would constitute in-service incurrence.
6134|9818|1718378P77S1|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|There were no symptoms or diagnoses noted in the Veteran's STRs.
6135|9820|1718378P77S2|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|He did make a statement regarding rage and depression he felt in October 1999, which is within one year of service, but he did not enter treatment until 2008.
6136|9822|1718378P77S3|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's first noted symptoms of depression began in 2003, and were listed as relating to life events, mainly family stressors.
6137|9825|1718378P77S4|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|"He did state that he pushed his feelings down in service and directly after because he felt no compassion or support from superiors while in military service; he recalled that he was told to ""quit whining"" and he did not want to deal with his depressive feelings."
6138|9826|1718378P77S5|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|Though his lay statements must be afforded due attention, clinical treatment notes indicated moderate depression associated with life events, such as family illness and death.
6139|9827|1718378P77S6|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|None describe behaviors reported in service were symptoms of current diagnoses.
6140|9829|1718378P78S1|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|Two medical opinions in the record discuss the effects of military service on the Veteran's current mental health, but as noted above, service connection requires the in-service incurrence of a disease or injury that resulted in the claimed disability.
6141|9831|1718378P78S2|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|These records do not describe an in-service disease or an in-service injury.
6142|9833|1718378P78S3|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|A private LCSW provided an opinion that stated that his exposure to violence and his own actions in those situations have continued to haunt him and affect his personal and vocational life.
6143|9834|1718378P78S4|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|Exposure to violence and the Veteran's action in those situations are not disease or injuries, and therefore, this does not describe any basis upon which award service connection.
6144|9835|1718378P78S5|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|A letter submitted by a LCSW referencing exposure to combat overseas carries no weight since the Veteran did not serve overseas in combat.
6145|9836|1718378P79S1|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|The April 2015 VA examination opinion includes a thorough history of the Veteran.
6146|9839|1718378P79S2|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The report discusses the divergent symptoms reported, the differing reports of his mental health history, and considers the symptoms witnessed in the Veteran versus those claimed.
6147|9841|1718378P79S3|1718378|False|EvidenceSentence|The opinion then concludes that the claimed disability is not related to service.
6148|9842|1718378P79S4|1718378|False|ReasoningSentence|Because the opinion is from a competent, credible source, and in view of its thoroughgoing nature, it is more probative than the LCSW letters.
6149|9844|1718378P80S1|1718378|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the preponderance of the evidence is thus against a finding that an acquired psychiatric disorder was incurred in service and the Veteran's claim must be denied.
6150|9845|1718378P80S2|1718378|False|LegalRuleSentence|The benefit-of-doubt rule does not apply when the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the claim.
