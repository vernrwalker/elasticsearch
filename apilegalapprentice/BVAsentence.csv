1|1|1302554P16S1|1302554|1|16|True|False|Sentence|FINDINGS OF FACT
2|2|1302554P20S1|1302554|1|20|True|False|FindingSentence|4. The Veteran did not have a psychiatric disorder in service that was unrelated to the use of drugs.
3|3|1302554P21S1|1302554|1|21|True|False|FindingSentence|5. The preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service or was aggravated during service.
4|4|1302554P24S1|1302554|1|24|True|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
5|5|1302554P110S1|1302554|1|110|True|False|Sentence|Analysis
6|6|1302554P111S1|1302554|1|111|True|False|FindingSentence|After reviewing all of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that was caused or aggravated by his service.
7|7|1302554P111S2|1302554|2|111|False|False|FindingSentence|In regard to direct service connection, although the Veteran has been diagnosed with depression or major depressive disorder subsequent to service, his most current examination shows that the Veteran either does not have depression or that any current depression is unrelated to the Veteran's military service.
8|8|1302554P111S3|1302554|3|111|False|False|EvidenceSentence|While the Veteran claimed that he was depressed and suicidal in service, the Veteran was admitted for inpatient treatment for substance induced psychosis in 1978 and no mention of any depression or suicidal thinking was made at that time or any other time in service.
9|9|1302554P111S4|1302554|4|111|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, his memories are contradicted by the more reliable contemporaneous evidence.
10|10|1302554P111S5|1302554|5|111|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, no diagnosis of depression was made until 1985, six years after the Veteran's service, and at that time there was also no indication that the Veteran's service had anything to do with his depression.
11|11|1302554P111S6|1302554|6|111|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, even if the Veteran does have depression, this occurred after service and the evidence shows it was not caused by service.
12|12|1302554P112S1|1302554|1|112|True|False|Sentence|The Board has considered the Veteran's lay statements.
13|13|1302554P112S2|1302554|2|112|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, although the statement from J.P.S. indicates that he was aware of the sexual trauma from the karate instructor at the time the Veteran started his active duty, the Veteran has said that he did not tell anyone of this until 1991 or, in the case of his family, until later.
14|14|1302554P112S3|1302554|3|112|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, even though the Veteran enlisted in the USMCR in August 1975, it is his contention that he realized he must leave active duty upon reporting for training in January 1976 to deal with his situation.
15|15|1302554P112S4|1302554|4|112|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The statement of J.P.S. tends to support this view of events by the Veteran.
16|16|1302554P112S5|1302554|5|112|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, it strains credulity to accept this information as the Veteran had months before service to change his mind about going on active duty.
17|17|1302554P112S6|1302554|6|112|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, he reported that he had no psychiatric problems at the time of his enlistment physical.
18|18|1302554P112S7|1302554|7|112|False|False|ReasoningSentence|He also received a meritorious promotion upon completion of basic training, a fact that is in stark contrast with his assertions of not being able to function and wanting to commit suicide during basic training.
19|19|1302554P113S1|1302554|1|113|True|False|EvidenceSentence|No other supporting lay statement has knowledge of the Veteran's actual service.
20|20|1302554P113S2|1302554|2|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The statement from G.S. relates to what he knew of the Veteran prior to service.
21|21|1302554P113S3|1302554|3|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The same is true of the statement from P.D.
22|22|1302554P113S4|1302554|4|113|False|False|ReasoningSentence|It is clear that both individuals thought highly of the Veteran and that they had positive relationships.
23|23|1302554P113S5|1302554|5|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Neither individual could, or did, address the Veteran's status in service.
24|24|1302554P113S6|1302554|6|113|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, they also are not aware of all of the facts in this matter and their challenges to determinations made or evidence contained in the record have no credibility.
25|25|1302554P113S7|1302554|7|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran himself has provided the statements, in regard to his sexual activities, drug use and religious practices to his care providers on multiple occasions, particularly in regard to his pre-service drug abuse.
26|26|1302554P113S8|1302554|8|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As stated several times, his mother has confirmed the Veteran's pre-service drug use.
27|27|1302554P113S9|1302554|9|113|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She has also related that she had difficulty in coping with the Veteran and his behavior.
28|28|1302554P114S1|1302554|1|114|True|False|Sentence|The Veteran claims that he also has PTSD that is related to his service.
29|29|1302554P114S2|1302554|2|114|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The May 2008 letter from the VA physician does not support the Veteran's claim.
30|30|1302554P114S3|1302554|3|114|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He noted the Veteran was treated in the clinic for PTSD related to the pre-service sexual trauma.
31|31|1302554P114S4|1302554|4|114|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The physician noted that, as a routine, a check of a veteran's DD 214 is done to review for stressors.
32|32|1302554P114S5|1302554|5|114|False|False|ReasoningSentence|He did not relate any military stressors for this Veteran and his DD 214 would not indicate any as the Veteran was not in combat and has not alleged such service.
33|33|1302554P115S1|1302554|1|115|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was examined three times.
34|34|1302554P115S2|1302554|2|115|False|False|EvidenceSentence|On two of those occasions, the Veteran was found to have PTSD that was related to child abuse and not anything that occurred in the military.
35|35|1302554P115S3|1302554|3|115|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's treatment records also show a PTSD diagnosis that is related to the pre-service sexual abuse.
36|36|1302554P115S4|1302554|4|115|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, sexual abuse in the military could not be corroborated.
37|37|1302554P115S5|1302554|5|115|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The only military stressor that was corroborated was the fact that a Marine who was injured prior to when the Veteran arrived at his duty station later died while hospitalized.
38|38|1302554P115S6|1302554|6|115|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, there is no evidence linking any diagnosis of PTSD or any other mental disorder to this event.
39|39|1302554P116S1|1302554|1|116|True|False|EvidenceSentence|On the third examination in May 2011, the Veteran was specifically evaluated for PTSD and was not found to even have this disorder.
40|40|1302554P116S2|1302554|2|116|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This conclusion is highly probative insofar as it was made based on a review of the entire claims folder, including documentation of the Veteran's extensive substance abuse and treatment history and after consideration of the opinions of the earlier two VA examiners, who acknowledged that it was hard to diagnose the Veteran because his answers were often vague or off topic.
41|41|1302554P117S1|1302554|1|117|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The third examiner determined that the Veteran did not have any psychiatric diagnosis and that no psychiatric symptoms were aggravated specifically by the Veteran's military service.
42|42|1302554P117S2|1302554|2|117|False|False|EvidenceSentence|While the two VA examiners who previously examined the Veteran opined that there may have been some minor aggravation of the Veteran's symptoms due to his military service, neither of them explained the mechanism through which this aggravation supposedly occurred or that there was evidence of PTSD in service.
43|43|1302554P117S3|1302554|3|117|False|False|FindingSentence|Notably, there is no credible evidence that any of the in-service events complained of by the Veteran, aside from the death of the recruit, actually occurred.
44|44|1302554P117S4|1302554|4|117|False|False|EvidenceSentence|While one recruit who was unknown to the Veteran and injured prior to the Veteran arriving at his duty station died while hospitalized, there is no evidence that an additional four of the Veteran's friends died in service as he claimed.
45|45|1302554P117S5|1302554|5|117|False|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no credible evidence that the Veteran was physically or sexually assaulted in service; he did not advance these contentions until his appeal was well underway and he never provided any specifics about the supposed assaults, other than to say that he was once invited to another soldier's home, to which he apparently did not go.
46|46|1302554P118S1|1302554|1|118|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, while the Veteran contended that he reported childhood sexual abuse to his commander and was not allowed to go home to cope with it, documentation such as treatment records and even the written statement from the Veteran's mother indicate that the Veteran was unaware of the sexual abuse until long after his military service.
47|47|1302554P118S2|1302554|2|118|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Also, his outstanding performance, as documented in his personnel records, as well as the letter of recommendation by his company commander and the dining facility officer do not support a conclusion that the Veteran's performance waned upon his graduation from basic training and receipt of a meritorious promotion.
48|48|1302554P119S1|1302554|1|119|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The three VA examination reports do not support a conclusion that a psychiatric disorder, other than the drug induced one from 1978, was present in service.
49|49|1302554P119S2|1302554|2|119|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The STRs are clearly negative for such evidence.
50|50|1302554P119S3|1302554|3|119|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran denied having any type of a psychiatric disorder, or history thereof, on his enlistment in the Navy in June 1981.
51|51|1302554P119S4|1302554|4|119|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The post-service treatment records do not provide supporting evidence to conclude that a psychiatric condition existed in service that was unrelated to the Veteran's drug abuse.
52|52|1302554P120S1|1302554|1|120|True|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record does not support a finding that the Veteran had a psychiatric condition in service other than the two drug-related diagnoses from 1978.
53|53|1302554P120S2|1302554|2|120|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It is clear from the 1978 discharge summary that the Veteran received extensive therapy and treatment over a two month period.
54|54|1302554P120S3|1302554|3|120|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The diagnoses were not determined without what appears to be a thorough understanding of the Veteran's psychiatric status, at the time of treatment and prior to the period of hospitalization.
55|55|1302554P120S4|1302554|4|120|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The history of drug abuse cited in the summary is supported by numerous admissions by the Veteran in his treatment by private and VA sources after service as well as by statements from his mother.
56|56|1302554P120S5|1302554|5|120|False|False|ReasoningSentence|There is no contrary competent medical evidence to show otherwise.
57|57|1302554P120S6|1302554|6|120|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|Service connection cannot be granted for disability due to intentional drug abuse.
58|58|1302554P120S7|1302554|7|120|False|False|CitationSentence|See 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.301(d).
59|59|1302554P121S1|1302554|1|121|True|False|Sentence|As noted above, the Board was directed to address the issue of aggravation of a preexisting disability through consideration of the presumption of soundness.
60|60|1302554P121S2|1302554|2|121|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the evidence shows the Veteran did not report any psychiatric problems on his medical history in August 1975 and no psychiatric issues were identified at the time of the physical examination.
61|61|1302554P122S1|1302554|1|122|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, also as noted above, the Court has specifically held that, even in cases where the evidence later shows that there was a preexisting disability that was not identified on entry to service, the presumption of soundness does not necessarily apply.
62|62|1302554P122S2|1302554|2|122|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|More to the point, absent the showing of the manifestation or incurrence of a disease or injury in service, there is no disability to consider for possible aggravation.
63|63|1302554P122S3|1302554|3|122|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 52 (2012).
64|64|1302554P122S4|1302554|4|122|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Court in Gilbert held that before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury - that was not noted upon entrance into service - manifested in service.
65|65|1302554P122S5|1302554|5|122|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|Otherwise stated, absent such manifestation, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
66|66|1302554P122S6|1302554|6|122|False|False|FindingSentence|That is the case here.
67|67|1302554P122S7|1302554|7|122|False|False|FindingSentence|No disability for which compensation may be paid (i.e, a disability which was not a drug induced psychiatric disorder) was manifest in service.
68|68|1302554P122S8|1302554|8|122|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
69|69|1302554P123S1|1302554|1|123|True|False|FindingSentence|It is clear from the evidence of record that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD that is based on his sexual trauma prior to service.
70|70|1302554P123S2|1302554|2|123|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran has given a history of several incidents, his primary incident involves the karate instructor and this has been the basis for the diagnosis by various providers and examiners.
71|71|1302554P123S3|1302554|3|123|False|False|FindingSentence|The stressor is unrelated to service.
72|72|1302554P124S1|1302554|1|124|True|False|FindingSentence|The Veteran's PTSD could not have been aggravated by his military service insofar as this implies that PTSD was present prior to, and during, the Veteran's service.
73|73|1302554P124S2|1302554|2|124|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, no psychiatric disorder other than organic brain syndrome due to drug abuse, which resolved, was present during service.
74|74|1302554P124S3|1302554|3|124|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board is of the opinion that the contemporaneous treatment records during service have the greatest probative value as to the Veteran's mental status at that time.
75|75|1302554P124S4|1302554|4|124|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This is particularly true when weighed against lay statements such as those given by the Veteran or in various written statements from persons who knew him during and after service.
76|76|1302554P124S5|1302554|5|124|False|False|EvidenceSentence|PTSD also was not present when the Veteran was treated as an outpatient or when he was hospitalized in the 1980s.
77|77|1302554P124S6|1302554|6|124|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This diagnosis did not appear until more than 20 years after the Veteran's service; therefore, it could not have been aggravated by service.
78|78|1302554P124S7|1302554|7|124|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Even more importantly, after a comprehensive review of all of the Veteran's treatment records and the prior medical opinions, the examiner who provided the May 2011 report of examination determined that the Veteran did not have PTSD or any other psychiatric disorder which could have been aggravated by service.
79|79|1302554P125S1|1302554|1|125|True|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the Veteran does not have a psychiatric disorder that is related to his military service.
80|80|1302554P125S2|1302554|2|125|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board concludes that a psychiatric disorder was not incurred in or aggravated by service.
81|81|1302554P125S3|1302554|3|125|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board acknowledges that VA is statutorily required to resolve the benefit of the doubt in favor of the Veteran when there is an approximate balance of positive and negative evidence regarding the merits of an outstanding issue.
82|82|1302554P125S4|1302554|4|125|False|False|FindingSentence|That doctrine is inapplicable in the instant case because the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim.
83|83|1302554P125S5|1302554|5|125|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 49, 55 (1990); 38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5107(b).
84|84|1302554P125S6|1302554|6|125|False|False|Sentence|Accordingly, the appeal is denied.

86|86|1303141P20S1|1303141|1|20|True|False|Sentence|FINDINGS OF FACT
87|87|1303141P21S1|1303141|1|21|True|False|FindingSentence|1. Clear and unmistakable evidence exists that the Veteran manifested a psychiatric disability prior to his service and that the aggravation of that disability during his service was a result of natural progression of the condition.
88|88|1303141P22S1|1303141|1|22|True|False|FindingSentence|2. The Veteran is not service-connected for any disability.
89|89|1303141P26S1|1303141|1|26|True|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
90|90|1303141P48S1|1303141|1|48|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|A current disability exists when there is a disability when a claim for it is filed or at any time during the pendency of such claim.
91|91|1303141P48S2|1303141|2|48|False|False|CitationSentence|McClain v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 319 (2007).
92|92|1303141P48S3|1303141|3|48|False|False|Sentence|The Veteran filed this claim in May 2003.
93|93|1303141P48S4|1303141|4|48|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Since then, psychiatric disabilities have been diagnosed.
94|94|1303141P48S5|1303141|5|48|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Diagnoses of schizoaffective disorder were made in VA treatment records and at the February 2008 VA mental disorders examination.
95|95|1303141P48S6|1303141|6|48|False|False|Sentence|A VA treatment record also documents a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
96|96|1303141P48S7|1303141|7|48|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Veteran currently has a psychiatric disability.
97|97|1303141P49S1|1303141|1|49|True|False|Sentence|The law specific to establishing service connection for posttruamatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not discussed herein because the PTSD diagnosis is not valid.
98|98|1303141P49S2|1303141|2|49|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The diagnosis of a mental disorder should conform to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).
99|99|1303141P49S3|1303141|3|49|False|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (2012).
100|100|1303141P49S4|1303141|4|49|False|False|FindingSentence|There is no indication of a diagnosis of PTSD conforming to DSM-IV here.
101|101|1303141P49S5|1303141|5|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The DSM-IV is not mentioned in the only VA treatment record diagnosing PTSD and those diagnoses do not contain evidence or discussion to show that the criteria of DSM-IV for the diagnosis are met.
102|102|1303141P49S6|1303141|6|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, voluminous VA treatment records and private treatment records dated both before and after this record diagnose a variety of psychiatric disabilities, but not PTSD.
103|103|1303141P50S1|1303141|1|50|True|False|FindingSentence|In addition to a current disability, the Veteran manifested a psychiatric disability during service.
104|104|1303141P50S2|1303141|2|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Service medical records show that he was hospitalized in April 1975 with an initial diagnosis of situational reaction after going on unauthorized absence and hiding under a building for three weeks.
105|105|1303141P50S3|1303141|3|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He stayed through mid May 1975 with a primary diagnosis of manic depressive illness, depressed type.
106|106|1303141P51S1|1303141|1|51|True|False|Sentence|The in-service manifestation necessitates consideration of the presumption of soundness.
107|107|1303141P51S2|1303141|2|51|False|False|CitationSentence|Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012) (presumption of soundness applies only when there is manifestation of a disease or injury during service).
108|108|1303141P51S3|1303141|3|51|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|A Veteran will be presumed to have been in sound condition when examined, accepted, and enrolled for service except as to defects, infirmities, or disorders noted at that time.
109|109|1303141P51S4|1303141|4|51|False|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111 (West 2002); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(b) (2012); Wagner v. Principi, 370 F.3d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 2004).
110|110|1303141P52S1|1303141|1|52|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the Veteran reported a history of frequent trouble sleeping, depression or excessive worry, and nervous trouble in December1974 just prior to his entry into service.
111|111|1303141P52S2|1303141|2|52|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He further reported having been treated for the mental condition of nervousness.
112|112|1303141P52S3|1303141|3|52|False|False|EvidenceSentence|His entrance examination, which was conducted the same day, did not find him either psychiatrically normal or abnormal.

371|371|1316146P73S3|1316146|3|73|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Unfortunately, the Board cannot consider those records for accrued benefit purposes since they are not VA records and were not associated with the claims file prior to the Veteran's death in December 2005.
372|372|1316146P73S4|1316146|4|73|False|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 5121(a); 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.1000(a), (d)(4); see Hayes, 4 Vet. App. at 360-61.
373|373|1316146P74S1|1316146|1|74|True|False|FindingSentence|Based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death, the Board finds that the Veteran did not have a diagnosis of PTSD based on verified stressors or under the revised criteria of 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(3).
374|374|1316146P74S2|1316146|2|74|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, while MCC Center diagnosed PTSD based on the Veteran's experiences in Vietnam, a VA or VA contracted provider did not confirm prior to the Veteran's death that his stressor was related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and that it was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
375|375|1316146P74S3|1316146|3|74|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, the VA examination conducted one month after the letter was submitted found that the Veteran did not meet all criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.

377|377|1316146P74S5|1316146|5|74|False|False|FindingSentence|Consequently, without a diagnosis of PTSD, service connection for PTSD for accrued benefits purposes must be denied.
378|378|1316146P75S1|1316146|1|75|True|False|FindingSentence|During the pendency of his claim, the Veteran continued to have a diagnosis of depression.
379|379|1316146P75S2|1316146|2|75|False|False|FindingSentence|However, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence does not show a relationship between depression and service.
380|380|1316146P75S3|1316146|3|75|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The only evidence indicating a nexus between service and acquired psychiatric disorders are his statements.
381|381|1316146P75S4|1316146|4|75|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, as noted above, the Veteran's statements regarding the onset and treatment of his acquired psychiatric disorders are inconsistent.
382|382|1316146P75S5|1316146|5|75|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically, he said his condition had its onset prior to service, during his first physical for basic training, upon leaving Vietnam, and after service in the 1970s.
383|383|1316146P75S6|1316146|6|75|False|False|ReasoningSentence|While laypersons are generally competent to report symptoms of disorders, in this case, the Board finds that the Veteran's recollections of his medical history are not consistent and therefore, not credible.
384|384|1316146P76S1|1316146|1|76|True|False|FindingSentence|The Board has considered the medical evidence, but finds that it also fails to indicate a relationship between service and any psychiatric disorders.
385|385|1316146P76S2|1316146|2|76|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At most, VA examiners opined that acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD had their onset prior to service.
386|386|1316146P76S3|1316146|3|76|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinions, which are not supported by rationale, appear to be based on the Veteran's statements alleging pre-service onset of his disorders.
387|387|1316146P76S4|1316146|4|76|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, because the Board finds that the Veteran's statements regarding his medical history are not credible, the Board, in turn, finds that the VA examiners' opinions are not credible or persuasive and are entitled to no probative value as they are based on the Veteran's reported history.
388|388|1316146P77S1|1316146|1|77|True|False|Sentence|Generally, the Board would remand this case to obtain an adequate VA examiner's opinion; however, because this claim is solely for the purpose of accrued benefits, the Board is not permitted to undertake development subsequent to the Veteran's death.
389|389|1316146P77S2|1316146|2|77|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, based on the evidence of record at the time of the Veteran's death, the Board finds that the preponderance of the evidence weighs against a finding of service connection for a psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, for accrued benefits purposes.
390|390|1316146P77S3|1316146|3|77|False|False|FindingSentence|The benefit of the doubt doctrine is not for application.

516|516|1316336P43S2|1316336|2|43|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The service medical records reflect no diagnosis of a psychiatric disability, the service personnel records reflect no notations suggestive of a behavioral change due to psychiatric symptoms, the first diagnosis of a psychiatric disability dates more than eight years after separation from military service, and VA examiners have provided opinions indicating that the current psychiatric disability did not begin during service: although the examiners did not explicitly make that determination, the Board finds the determinations that the condition preexisted service are de facto determinations that the condition did not begin during service.
517|517|1316336P43S3|1316336|3|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board acknowledges that the Veteran has reported that his psychiatric symptoms began during service.

532|532|1316336P45S3|1316336|3|45|False|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the Board finds a psychiatric disability did not manifest during military service, and the presumption of soundness does not apply.

644|644|1340434P38S2|1340434|2|38|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Specifically, in his September 2007 claim, the Veteran asserts that he never experienced mental issues before service, but ""became easily irritated and alarmed during service and it has never diminished."""
645|645|1340434P39S1|1340434|1|39|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In his October 2007 stressor statement, the Veteran listed four stressors.
646|646|1340434P39S2|1340434|2|39|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"First, he stated that ""I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor."""
647|647|1340434P39S3|1340434|3|39|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Second, he asserted that ""I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush."""

652|652|1340434P39S8|1340434|8|39|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran concluded that those stressors made it ""hard for me to concentrate on my studies as a Tower Operator."
653|653|1340434P39S9|1340434|9|39|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"And that's why I failed the course."""
654|654|1340434P39S10|1340434|10|39|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"In February 2008, the Veteran added that ""I did receive stress counseling in service at Ft. Rucker as I was failing my course."""
655|655|1340434P40S1|1340434|1|40|True|False|EvidenceSentence|"In his October 2009 substantive appeal, the Veteran added that ""my frostbite residuals...cause me much anxiety and frustration."""
656|656|1340434P41S1|1340434|1|41|True|False|FindingSentence|After reviewing the record, the Board finds that the most probative evidence is against a finding of in-service incurrence or aggravation of an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD; there is no credible supporting evidence that any claimed in-service stressor occurred; and the most probative evidence demonstrates that the Veteran's service-connected residuals of frostbite did not cause or aggravate an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD.
657|657|1340434P42S1|1340434|1|42|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|As a finder of fact, when considering whether lay evidence is credible, the Board may properly consider the internal inconsistency of the statements, facial plausibility, and consistency with other evidence submitted on behalf of the Veteran.
658|658|1340434P42S2|1340434|2|42|False|False|CitationSentence|See Dalton v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 23, 38 (2007); Caluza v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 498, 511 (1995), aff'd per curiam, 78 F.3d 604 (Fed. Cir. 1996).
659|659|1340434P43S1|1340434|1|43|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Here, the multiple contradictions in the Veteran's evidence lead the Board to conclude that the alleged incidents and stressors did not occur.
660|660|1340434P43S2|1340434|2|43|False|False|ReasoningSentence|First, the Veteran expressly denied experiencing psychiatric symptoms in service in his April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical History, wherein he checked boxes indicating that he did not have, and had never had, depression or excessive worry, loss of memory or amnesia, or nervous trouble of any sort.
661|661|1340434P43S3|1340434|3|43|False|False|CitationSentence|See Curry v. Brown, 7 Vet. App. 59, 68 (1994) (contemporaneous evidence has greater probative value than subsequently reported history).
662|662|1340434P43S4|1340434|4|43|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, in April 1977 and May 1977 Reports of Medical Examination, clinicians found that the Veteran was psychiatrically normal.
663|663|1340434P43S5|1340434|5|43|False|False|CitationSentence|See Buczynski v. Shinseki, 24 Vet.App. 221, 224 (2011) (noting that where there is a lack of notation of medical condition or symptoms where such notation would normally be expected, the Board may consider this as evidence that the condition or symptoms did not exist).
664|664|1340434P43S6|1340434|6|43|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Third, the Veteran's counseling records were for academics, not stress-as the Veteran inaccurately asserted in a February 2008 letter to VA.
665|665|1340434P43S7|1340434|7|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, in a June 1977 service personnel record a counselor opined that:
666|666|1340434P44S1|1340434|1|44|True|False|EvidenceSentence|I have personally interviewed this SM and found him to have a good attitude towards the Army.
667|667|1340434P44S2|1340434|2|44|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, he has a serious academic problem.
668|668|1340434P44S3|1340434|3|44|False|False|EvidenceSentence|His ability to read and comprehend the material in his AIT course is extremely poor, and his exam grades indicated that he will develop[] into a marginal soldier at best.
669|669|1340434P44S4|1340434|4|44|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Recommendation: I don't feel that this SM can obtain an MOS and recommend he be discharged.
670|670|1340434P45S1|1340434|1|45|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Similarly, the Veteran's own contemporaneous assessment reflected academic, rather than psychiatric, concerns, as described by an in-service supervisor in his service personnel records:
671|671|1340434P46S1|1340434|1|46|True|False|EvidenceSentence|He says that he doesn't know what the problem is but guesses [that the test is] too hard.
672|672|1340434P46S2|1340434|2|46|False|False|EvidenceSentence|I agree with him-it is too hard for him and he should not be in a service organization where his and other persons' lives may depend upon his ability to respond logically and rapidly to requirements.
673|673|1340434P46S3|1340434|3|46|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He tried the Active Army and could not pass the tests.
674|674|1340434P47S1|1340434|1|47|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Fourth, the Veteran's stressor statements to VA clinicians and examiners are often unrelated to, or in direct contradiction with, his stressor statements in support of his claim.
675|675|1340434P47S2|1340434|2|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, the Veteran told a treating VA psychiatrist in September 2007 that he had not seen the recruit shoot a drill sergeant, but rather had heard about it.
676|676|1340434P47S3|1340434|3|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"This conflicts with the Veteran's October 2007 stressor statement wherein he stated that ""I witness[ed] Pvt. [name omitted] trying to kill [an] instructor by drawing his weapon on [an] instructor."""
677|677|1340434P47S4|1340434|4|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, the Veteran told his treating VA psychiatrist in November 2008 that he remembered one surgeon scraping another with a metal brush in service, causing bleeding in his body.
678|678|1340434P47S5|1340434|5|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"This appears to be a variant of his October 2007 assertion that ""I witness[ed] in Ft. Rucker a group of Privates force bathing another Private with a steel brush."""
679|679|1340434P47S6|1340434|6|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, the Veteran told a VA psychologist in August 2007 that he had been revolted and horrified in service by one of his superiors who kept on his desk a large jar of pickled ears from dead NVA and Vietcong soldiers; the Veteran never listed this stressor in his claim.
680|680|1340434P48S1|1340434|1|48|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Based on the foregoing, the Board concludes that the Veteran's reports of in-service incidents and stressors lack credibility.
681|681|1340434P49S1|1340434|1|49|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 2013, VA obtained a medical opinion as to the Veteran's claimed PTSD and psychiatric disorders.
682|682|1340434P49S2|1340434|2|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The clinician opined that ""It is LESS LIKELY THAN NOT that the Veteran's claimed mental health condition, to include PTSD, incurred, was caused by or proximately due to his 6 months in military service."""
683|683|1340434P49S3|1340434|3|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"In support of her opinion, the clinician relied on the absence of verification of the Veteran's stressors; the in-service counseling report showing discharge due to an academic deficiency; and the absence of ""medically based scientific evidence found in his service record to indicate that his short time in military service...[was] the underlying cause of his current diagnoses of PTSD and Depression."""
684|684|1340434P49S4|1340434|4|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The clinician also opined that it is less likely than not that the Veteran's mental health condition is caused by, proximately due to, or related to his service-connected bilateral lower extremity disabilities, to include peripheral neuropathy and vascular disease, because ""[t]here is no current literature or scientifically based medical evidence to support such a nexus."""
685|685|1340434P50S1|1340434|1|50|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the clinician's opinion is competent because she is qualified through education, training, or experience to offer medical diagnoses, statements, or opinions.
686|686|1340434P50S2|1340434|2|50|False|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.159(a)(1).
687|687|1340434P50S3|1340434|3|50|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Also, the clinician's etiological opinions are credible based on their internal consistency and her duty to provide truthful opinions.
688|688|1340434P50S4|1340434|4|50|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board further finds that the March 2013 clinician's opinion is most probative because she considered the Veteran's medical records and discussed his medical history, provided unequivocal and conclusive opinions, and offered clear reasoning for her conclusions.
689|689|1340434P50S5|1340434|5|50|False|False|CitationSentence|See Nieves-Rodriguez v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 295 (2008); see also Stefl v. Nicholson, 21 Vet. App. 120, 124 (2007).
690|690|1340434P51S1|1340434|1|51|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|Where, as here, conflicting competent opinions are of record, the Board can ascribe greater probative weight to one opinion over another, provided that a rational basis is given.
691|691|1340434P51S2|1340434|2|51|False|False|CitationSentence|Winsett v. West, 11 Vet. App. 420 (1998), aff'd 217 F.3d 854 (Fed. Cir. 1999).
692|692|1340434P51S3|1340434|3|51|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board is cognizant of the February 2008 VA psychologist's letter, the additional VA treatment records, and the December 2012 VA examination report linking the Veteran's PTSD to his service.
693|693|1340434P51S4|1340434|4|51|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board accords those opinions less probative weight because they are based on acceptance of the Veteran's reported stressors which, as the Board demonstrated above, lack credibility.
694|694|1340434P51S5|1340434|5|51|False|False|CitationSentence|Id.
695|695|1340434P52S1|1340434|1|52|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Likewise, the Board finds that the March 2013 VA medical opinion warrants greater probative weight than the Veteran's own contentions, based on the examiner's greater knowledge and expertise, as well as her greater factual accuracy in accordance with the claims file. 
696|696|1340434P52S2|1340434|2|52|False|False|CitationSentence|See Kahana v. Shinseki, 24 Vet. App. 428 (2011).
697|697|1340434P53S1|1340434|1|53|True|False|FindingSentence|The Board further finds that service connection for PTSD is not warranted under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f) because the Veteran was not diagnosed with PTSD during service, did not engage in combat with the enemy, did not experience a stressor related to fear of hostile military or terrorist activity, was not a prisoner-of-war, and did not sustain an in-service personal assault.
698|698|1340434P54S1|1340434|1|54|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The most probative evidence of record shows that the Veteran's psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, are unrelated to service or to his service-connected residuals of frostbite.
699|699|1340434P54S2|1340434|2|54|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, reasonable doubt does not apply, and the Veteran's appeal of the issue of entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, including PTSD, is denied.

703|703|1343153P22S1|1343153|1|22|True|False|FindingSentence|3. The presumption of soundness does not apply as it is not shown that the Veteran's PTSD manifested during her service.
704|704|1343153P23S1|1343153|1|23|True|False|FindingSentence|4. The Veteran is currently diagnosed with PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
705|705|1343153P23S2|1343153|2|23|False|False|FindingSentence|5. In-service stressors, sufficient to support a diagnosis of PTSD, have been verified.
706|706|1343153P24S1|1343153|1|24|True|False|FindingSentence|6. The Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service, and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.
707|707|1343153P27S1|1343153|1|27|True|False|Sentence|REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDINGS AND CONCLUSION
708|708|1343153P41S1|1343153|1|41|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the Veteran contends that she currently experiences symptoms of PTSD, including nightmares and flashbacks of various events that she photographed and from pictures that she processed while working as a still photographer in service.
709|709|1343153P41S2|1343153|2|41|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As such, she believes that her current psychiatric problems are related to her military service.
710|710|1343153P41S3|1343153|3|41|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also asserted that she was placed on medical hold shortly after she entered service, and testified that not knowing whether she would be able to continue her military service caused her a great deal of stress.
711|711|1343153P42S1|1343153|1|42|True|False|Sentence|Initially, the Board must determine whether the presumption of soundness under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1111, 1132 applies in this case.
712|712|1343153P42S2|1343153|2|42|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The relevant evidence on this question includes a February 2007 VA examination report where the examiner opined that it was at least as likely as not that the Veteran suffered PTSD in her youth and that this was ""possibly aggravated"" by service."
713|713|1343153P42S3|1343153|3|42|False|False|FindingSentence|Although this evidence suggests that an acquired psychiatric disability, to include PTSD, pre-existed entrance into service, the Board finds that the presumption of soundness has not been rebutted by clear and unmistakable evidence that an acquired psychiatric disability existed prior to service as required under 38 U.S.C.A. Â§Â§ 1111, 1132.
714|714|1343153P43S1|1343153|1|43|True|False|FindingSentence|In this regard, the Board finds that the Veteran was found to be psychiatrically normal at a November 1984 physical examination prior to entrance into service.
715|715|1343153P43S2|1343153|2|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, although the Veteran has acknowledged that she had a childhood history of abuse, she has also stated that she did not have psychiatric problems upon entry into service.
716|716|1343153P43S3|1343153|3|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|On a medical history survey completed in conjunction with her enlistment physical, the Veteran denied any history of nervous trouble, frequent trouble sleeping, or depression.
717|717|1343153P43S4|1343153|4|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, in the most recent June 2013 VA examination report, conducted pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the VA examiner acknowledged that there was no pre-service medical documentation suggesting that the Veteran's PTSD had its onset prior to service, and thus concluded that the Veteran's PTSD did not pre-exist service.
718|718|1343153P44S1|1343153|1|44|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, as noted, the presumption of soundness applies only where there is evidence that a disease or injury was not noted upon entry into service manifested or was incurred in service.
719|719|1343153P44S2|1343153|2|44|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48, 54 (2012).
720|720|1343153P44S3|1343153|3|44|False|False|Sentence|The Court has cautioned that the presumption of soundness is not a sword for a veteran to fulfill the second element of service connection without any evidence of the manifestation of an in-service disability.

722|722|1343153P44S5|1343153|5|44|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|Otherwise stated, before the presumption of soundness is for application, there must be evidence that a disease or injury that was not noted upon entry to service manifested or was incurred in service.

Cir. 2009) (the presumption of soundness does not ""relieve the veteran of the burden of showing that [he] suffered from a disease or injury while in service""); Horn v. Shinseki, 25 Vet. App. 231, 236 (2012) (""In order to invoke the presumption of soundness, a claimant must show that he or she suffered from a disease or injury while in service."")."
724|724|1343153P45S1|1343153|1|45|True|False|FindingSentence|Here, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD manifested during service.
725|725|1343153P45S2|1343153|2|45|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As the examiner in June 2013 explained, the service treatment records did not show the diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.
726|726|1343153P45S3|1343153|3|45|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran was referred for a mental health consultation in June 1990 to evaluate the Veteran's extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.
727|727|1343153P45S4|1343153|4|45|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Specifically in June 1990, just two months before separation, the Veteran was evaluated by the chief of the mental health clinic.
728|728|1343153P45S5|1343153|5|45|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, no Axis I psychiatric disability was diagnosed following that evaluation.
729|729|1343153P45S6|1343153|6|45|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had an Axis I psychiatric disability during service.
730|730|1343153P46S1|1343153|1|46|True|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that the Veteran has alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of a psychiatric disability.
731|731|1343153P46S2|1343153|2|46|False|False|CitationSentence|See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
732|732|1343153P46S3|1343153|3|46|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the medical officer evaluated the Veteran during service, but found that her reported symptoms did not warrant the diagnosis of an Axis I psychiatric disability.
733|733|1343153P47S1|1343153|1|47|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|As was explained, absent the predicate finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
734|734|1343153P47S2|1343153|2|47|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert, supra.
735|735|1343153P47S3|1343153|3|47|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability onset or was present during service.
736|736|1343153P47S4|1343153|4|47|False|False|Sentence|In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.
737|737|1343153P47S5|1343153|5|47|False|False|Sentence|However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.
738|738|1343153P47S6|1343153|6|47|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, even though the Veteran has since service identified several in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of any Axis I psychiatric disability.
739|739|1343153P47S7|1343153|7|47|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
740|740|1343153P48S1|1343153|1|48|True|False|Sentence|The analysis does not stop here, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD was either caused or aggravated by her military service.
741|741|1343153P49S1|1343153|1|49|True|False|FindingSentence|The occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are adequately verified in the record, as her personnel records reflect that she photographically documented an aircraft accident, and a statement from a fellow service photographer, corroborates that she was responsible for documenting plane crashes, child abuse incidents, and spousal abuse incidents, as well as an occasion when a flight-line airman was killed when a landing gear tire exploded.
742|742|1343153P49S2|1343153|2|49|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the Board finds that the Veteran had these experiences during service.
743|743|1343153P49S3|1343153|3|49|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD.
744|744|1343153P50S1|1343153|1|50|True|False|Sentence|However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.
745|745|1343153P51S1|1343153|1|51|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD.
746|746|1343153P51S2|1343153|2|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran has pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service as evidence of the onset of an acquired psychiatric disability, the medical evidence of record from service does not actually show that any psychiatric disorder was ever diagnosed despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.
747|747|1343153P51S3|1343153|3|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The record shows that the Veteran was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985; however, the mental status examination was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.
748|748|1343153P51S4|1343153|4|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that the Veteran's records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems, and that she was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.
749|749|1343153P51S5|1343153|5|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints, abnormalities or diagnosis for any psychiatric problems during service.

753|753|1343153P52S2|1343153|2|52|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The records show that the Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.
754|754|1343153P53S1|1343153|1|53|True|False|EvidenceSentence|A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).
755|755|1343153P53S2|1343153|2|53|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.
756|756|1343153P53S3|1343153|3|53|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.
757|757|1343153P54S1|1343153|1|54|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.
758|758|1343153P54S2|1343153|2|54|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.
759|759|1343153P54S3|1343153|3|54|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was counseled numerous times on the condition of her dormitory room, her personal hygiene and the condition of her uniform with little or no improvement.

763|763|1343153P55S1|1343153|1|55|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have aver the previous six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military service.
764|764|1343153P56S1|1343153|1|56|True|False|EvidenceSentence|On a Report of Medical History for separation from service in July 1990, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort, and no pertinent psychiatric abnormalities were found on examination at that time.
765|765|1343153P57S1|1343153|1|57|True|False|EvidenceSentence|As described, the evidence does not show that the Veteran's PTSD was diagnosed either during her military service or for many years thereafter.

767|767|1343153P57S3|1343153|3|57|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, no psychiatric disorder was diagnosed at the time of discharge from service.
768|768|1343153P57S4|1343153|4|57|False|False|ReasoningSentence|These pieces of evidence weigh heavily against a finding that the Veteran's later diagnosed PTSD was incurred in or is otherwise related to her military service.
769|769|1343153P58S1|1343153|1|58|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, in the June 2013 VA examination report, the examiner found that while the Veteran did have a repeated pattern of misconduct during service, it was a result of her personality disorder, and not PTSD.
770|770|1343153P58S2|1343153|2|58|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative as the examiner conducted an in-depth review of the claims file, and provided a detailed rationale for all opinions rendered.
771|771|1343153P58S3|1343153|3|58|False|False|CitationSentence|See Prejean, 13 Vet. App. at 448-9.
772|772|1343153P58S4|1343153|4|58|False|False|FindingSentence|For these reasons, the Board finds that PTSD was not incurred in service and was not evidenced by the numerous outbursts and problems in service.
773|773|1343153P59S1|1343153|1|59|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Also weighing against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events are the post-service treatment records.
774|774|1343153P59S2|1343153|2|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Review of the VBMS record reveals that the Veteran first initiated contact with a mental health professional in June 2002 at which time the Veteran related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle consisting of bondage and sadomasochism."""
775|775|1343153P59S3|1343153|3|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She also went into detail about abuse suffered as a child.
776|776|1343153P59S4|1343153|4|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005 when she was psychiatrically hospitalized at the Tucson VA due to depression with suicidal ideation including a plan to jump off a bridge or walk into the desert and never return.
777|777|1343153P59S5|1343153|5|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily due to the Veteran's ex-wife.
778|778|1343153P60S1|1343153|1|60|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported nightmares about children being beaten and her father harming her sister.
779|779|1343153P60S2|1343153|2|60|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She also reported the death of her fiancÃ© in 1997 as very upsetting.

781|781|1343153P60S4|1343153|4|60|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, dreams, and anger.
782|782|1343153P60S5|1343153|5|60|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequently, in December 2006, the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD and dysthymic disorder.
783|783|1343153P60S6|1343153|6|60|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which was predominantly related to childhood abuse.
784|784|1343153P61S1|1343153|1|61|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was also afforded a VA examination in February 2007 to assist in determining the nature and etiology of her psychiatric disorders.
785|785|1343153P61S2|1343153|2|61|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Upon review of the claims file and mental status examination, the examiner diagnosed PTSD from childhood abuse, possibly aggravated by military service.
786|786|1343153P61S3|1343153|3|61|False|False|ReasoningSentence|"However, the use of ""possibly"" renders the opinion too equivocal to provide the requisite nexus."
787|787|1343153P61S4|1343153|4|61|False|False|CitationSentence|See Obert v. Brown, 5 Vet. App. 30, 33 (1993).
788|788|1343153P61S5|1343153|5|61|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Pursuant to the Board's May 2013 remand, the Veteran was afforded a second VA examination in June 2013 to investigate whether the verified in-service stressors caused or aggravated her currently diagnosed PTSD.
789|789|1343153P61S6|1343153|6|61|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.
790|790|1343153P61S7|1343153|7|61|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, she found that that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular syndrome of PTSD.
791|791|1343153P62S1|1343153|1|62|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.
792|792|1343153P62S2|1343153|2|62|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.
793|793|1343153P62S3|1343153|3|62|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the majority of treatment notes in the electronic medical record pertain to the Veteran's childhood abuse.
794|794|1343153P62S4|1343153|4|62|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancÃ© died.
795|795|1343153P62S5|1343153|5|62|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In recent treatment, she cited this as the most traumatic event experienced.
796|796|1343153P62S6|1343153|6|62|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.
797|797|1343153P63S1|1343153|1|63|True|False|EvidenceSentence|"Notably, the examiner explained that the Veteran had not met Criteria ""B"" under the DSM-IV PTSD criteria (i.e., symptoms of reexperiencing) because her symptoms were predominately related to childhood traumas."
798|798|1343153P63S2|1343153|2|63|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Similarly, the record did not reflect documentation of symptoms supporting Criteria ""C"" and ""D"" under the DSM-IV (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) which were relatable to the Veteran's in-service stressor events."
799|799|1343153P63S3|1343153|3|63|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Based on these reasons, the June 2013 VA examiner opined that the Veteran's childhood abuse and her fiancÃ©e's death in 1997, and not the in-service events, were the contributing stressors to the Veteran's PTSD diagnosis.
800|800|1343153P63S4|1343153|4|63|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner further opined that currently diagnosed PTSD was less likely than not incurred in or caused by the claimed in-service stressors.
801|801|1343153P63S5|1343153|5|63|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As previously noted, the Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.
802|802|1343153P64S1|1343153|1|64|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board also requested the examiner to consider whether the Veteran's repeated misconduct during service was indicative of the onset of her PTSD.
803|803|1343153P64S2|1343153|2|64|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service, but suggested that it was a result of her previously diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her diagnosis of PTSD.
804|804|1343153P64S3|1343153|3|64|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner noted that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any psychiatric disorder having been diagnosed or any mention of symptoms of anxiety or depression as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.
805|805|1343153P64S4|1343153|4|64|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties were occurring as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.
806|806|1343153P65S1|1343153|1|65|True|False|Sentence|In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.
807|807|1343153P65S2|1343153|2|65|False|False|Sentence|"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem, or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors."
808|808|1343153P66S1|1343153|1|66|True|False|Sentence|The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors, and suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service, and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have brought the childhood traumas back up for the Veteran, and even now be hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.
809|809|1343153P67S1|1343153|1|67|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has considered this argument, and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.
810|810|1343153P67S2|1343153|2|67|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, if the portion of the examination report cited by the representative were to be read in isolation, it might appear to leave open the possibility that the Veteran's PTSD could have been aggravated by her in-service experiences.
811|811|1343153P67S3|1343153|3|67|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, when the opinion is read in its entirety, the VA examiner's opinion is very clear that she does not believe that the Veteran's corroborated in-service stressors caused or aggravated her PTSD.
812|812|1343153P68S1|1343153|1|68|True|False|EvidenceSentence|"Although the examiner found that the witnessing of a traumatic event, such as the ones experienced by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criteria ""A"" under the DSM-IV for PTSD, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criteria B, C, or D under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences."
813|813|1343153P68S2|1343153|2|68|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and not with the Veteran's experiences in service.
814|814|1343153P68S3|1343153|3|68|False|False|ReasoningSentence|"Moreover, although the representative has suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors."
815|815|1343153P69S1|1343153|1|69|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board has also considered the Veteran's statements purporting to relate her currently diagnosed PTSD to her verified in-service stressor event.
816|816|1343153P69S2|1343153|2|69|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Upon review of the evidence of record, the Board finds that the Veteran's statements are not credible as they are inconsistent with, and outweighed by, other lay and medical evidence of record.
817|817|1343153P69S3|1343153|3|69|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|Credibility can be generally evaluated by a showing of interest, bias or inconsistent statements; and the demeanor of the witness, facial plausibility of the testimony, and the consistency of the witness testimony are also factors that may be considered.

821|821|1343153P70S1|1343153|1|70|True|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.
822|822|1343153P70S2|1343153|2|70|False|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.
823|823|1343153P70S3|1343153|3|70|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported first realizing that there was something wrong in approximately 2002, and that after doing some research, she realized that she had all the symptoms described for PTSD, including hypervigilance and panic attacks.
824|824|1343153P70S4|1343153|4|70|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.
825|825|1343153P70S5|1343153|5|70|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.
826|826|1343153P71S1|1343153|1|71|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service several times a week, she never described or reported any such symptoms related to service to any healthcare provider at anytime during the pendency of this appeal, including when examined by VA in 2007.
827|827|1343153P71S2|1343153|2|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks."
828|828|1343153P71S3|1343153|3|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered as a child and of witnessing the rape of her sister.
829|829|1343153P71S4|1343153|4|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At one point, she reported having vivid flashbacks of parts of an incident in which she was raped while living with her father, and said that she had them over and over, daily.

834|834|1343153P72S1|1343153|1|72|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Further, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005; as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until more than two years after she first sought psychiatric help.

836|836|1343153P72S3|1343153|3|72|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Even then, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service, and said only that when she hears a child cry, it reminds her of a child she photographed in service that had been abused.

838|838|1343153P72S5|1343153|5|72|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or at least some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed was related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some five years later - and more than two years after she initially sought psychiatric treatment - is not believable or credible.
839|839|1343153P73S1|1343153|1|73|True|False|ReasoningSentence|For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.
840|840|1343153P73S2|1343153|2|73|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancÃ©e.

942|942|1400029P128S1|1400029|1|128|True|False|EvidenceSentence|On the other hand, a December 1991 VA psychological examiner diagnosed with Veteran with generalized anxiety disorder, but would not confirm a diagnosis for PTSD.
943|943|1400029P128S2|1400029|2|128|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in rendering this opinion, the VA examiner did not have access to the Veteran's claims folder or any of the treatment records immediately after discharge reflecting the Veteran's complaints of nervousness.
944|944|1400029P128S3|1400029|3|128|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, this VA opinion is entitled to limited probative value.
945|945|1400029P129S1|1400029|1|129|True|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2010 VA psychological examiner also provided a very detailed discussion of the Veteran's history of psychiatric treatment since discharge from service in 1971.
946|946|1400029P129S2|1400029|2|129|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner discussed the Veteran's in-service stressors thoroughly; however, the VA examiner opined that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD or any other mental disorder.
947|947|1400029P129S3|1400029|3|129|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA examiner indicated that the overall level of stress exposure based on frequency and severity of incident exposure was ""low."""

949|949|1400029P129S5|1400029|5|129|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, the examiner remarked that the Veteran did not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD of reporting symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal.
950|950|1400029P129S6|1400029|6|129|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This examination provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.
951|951|1400029P130S1|1400029|1|130|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Additionally, a November 2010 VA mental health assessment from a nurse practitioner indicated that a diagnosis of PTSD had to be ruled out, but added that, based on his reported symptoms, he had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder and dysthymia and did not meet the criteria for PTSD at that time.
952|952|1400029P130S2|1400029|2|130|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran warranted further evaluation in the future due to his traumatic stressors as a firefighter and in Vietnam.
953|953|1400029P130S3|1400029|3|130|False|False|EvidenceSentence|None of the other VA mental health records dated in 2010 diagnosed PTSD.
954|954|1400029P130S4|1400029|4|130|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"In fact, at a December 2010 VA mental health assessment, the Veteran ""was unable to identify a specific stressor that may account for his 'nervousness' following time in Vietnam."""
955|955|1400029P131S1|1400029|1|131|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a September 2011 VA psychological examiner found that the Veteran's symptoms did not meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD under the DSM-IV or any other mental disorder.
956|956|1400029P131S2|1400029|2|131|False|False|EvidenceSentence|After discussing the Veteran's stressors, the VA examiner concluded that the Veteran's stressors were not sufficiently traumatic and were not adequate to support a diagnosis of PTSD for this particular Veteran.
957|957|1400029P131S3|1400029|3|131|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, the VA examiner indicated that the Veteran also answered in the negative regarding every single criterion for PTSD when specifically queried by the examiner about each and every symptom.
958|958|1400029P131S4|1400029|4|131|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examination revealed that he did not meet the DSM-IV criterion A through E for PTSD.
959|959|1400029P131S5|1400029|5|131|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In particular, the Veteran did not persistently reexperience his traumatic events from Vietnam; there was no persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma or numbing of general responsiveness; there were no persistent symptoms of increased arousal; and the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD.
960|960|1400029P131S6|1400029|6|131|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also did not endorse a single symptom of clinical depression.
961|961|1400029P131S7|1400029|7|131|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This examination also provides strong evidence against the existence of a current PTSD diagnosis attributable to in-service stressors from Vietnam.
962|962|1400029P131S8|1400029|8|131|False|False|FindingSentence|Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV).
963|963|1400029P131S9|1400029|9|131|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, the November 2010 and September 2011 VA psychological examinations in particular were thorough, supported by an explanation, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.
964|964|1400029P131S10|1400029|10|131|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The VA opinions and treatment records outweigh the private treatment of record on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV.
965|965|1400029P131S11|1400029|11|131|False|False|ReasoningSentence|After an extensive interview and testing, the VA examiners provided greater detail in assessing whether the Veteran met each of the DSM-IV criteria (A through E) for PTSD than the private psychologist, Dr. A.G.
966|966|1400029P132S1|1400029|1|132|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|With regard to lay evidence, the Board notes that lay persons are not categorically incompetent to speak on matters of medical diagnosis or etiology.

972|972|1400029P132S7|1400029|7|132|False|False|ReasoningSentence|That notwithstanding, in the instant case, the Board has found the Veteran's lay statements are less persuasive than the post-service medical evidence finding that the Veteran does not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD.
973|973|1400029P132S8|1400029|8|132|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.

983|983|1413417P145S1|1413417|1|145|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board notes that when a claimant makes a claim, he is seeking service connection for symptoms regardless of how those symptoms are diagnosed or labeled.
984|984|1413417P145S2|1413417|2|145|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|As such, the Board has recharacterized the issue of entitlement to service connection for PTSD as entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD.
985|985|1413417P145S3|1413417|3|145|False|False|CitationSentence|See Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1 (2009).
986|986|1413417P146S1|1413417|1|146|True|False|ReasoningSentence|While the appellant has filed a claim seeking PTSD, and has submitted a number of documents describing the military's efforts to address psychiatric combat trauma, the appellant has not actually presented any evidence to show that he has actually been diagnosed with PTSD, or even if he has, that it is in anyway related to his military service.
987|987|1413417P147S1|1413417|1|147|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant in several of his lengthy statements has suggested that several training exercises for ROTC were stressful, or that he was treated unfairly during service.
988|988|1413417P147S2|1413417|2|147|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He also states studying combat tactics in ROTC classes and participating in training exercises was the same as stressors veterans in combat experience.
989|989|1413417P147S3|1413417|3|147|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Even if such incidents were stressful to him, a diagnosis of PTSD would need to be based upon such an incident.
990|990|1413417P147S4|1413417|4|147|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, no such diagnosis is present.
991|991|1413417P147S5|1413417|5|147|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Of note, a number of psychiatric treatment records have been obtained, including from the appellant's psychiatric hospitalization in December 1990 and January 1991, but the records simply do not show that PTSD was ever diagnosed.
992|992|1413417P148S1|1413417|1|148|True|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent the appellant believes that he has PTSD from service, he lacks the medical training and expertise to address a complex medical question such as diagnosing a specific psychiatric disability.
993|993|1413417P148S2|1413417|2|148|False|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
994|994|1413417P148S3|1413417|3|148|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the appellant's claim for PTSD is therefore denied.
995|995|1413417P149S1|1413417|1|149|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Turning to the issue of an acquired psychiatric disorder, other than PTSD, it was noted in several service treatment records that the appellant had a history of psychiatric treatment which predated service.
996|996|1413417P149S2|1413417|2|149|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The appellant has requested that the Board obtain records from this psychiatric treatment at Bayberry Hospital, but the Board concludes that such records could not serve to benefit the appellant.
997|997|1413417P149S3|1413417|3|149|False|False|CitationSentence|See Sabonis v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 426, 430 (1994) (remands which would only result in unnecessarily imposing additional burdens on VA with no benefit flowing to the veteran are to be avoided).
998|998|1413417P150S1|1413417|1|150|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant was found to be psychiatrically normal at his physical examination just prior to his ROTC summer camp.
999|999|1413417P150S2|1413417|2|150|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the presumption of soundness does not apply to active duty for training or inactive duty for training.

1001|1001|1413417P150S4|1413417|4|150|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Regardless, even if the appellant was treated prior to his ROTC summer camp, the fact remains that there is no record of any psychiatric manifestations during the 1969 summer camp.
1002|1002|1413417P151S1|1413417|1|151|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|A previous psychiatric hospitalization might be relevant to the extent that the appellant's period of service from September to December 1970 was active duty, and he would therefore be entitled to the presumption of soundness based on the normal psychiatric profile on his physical examination in October 1970.
1003|1003|1413417P151S2|1413417|2|151|False|False|CitationSentence|38 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1111.
1004|1004|1413417P151S3|1413417|3|151|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, the fact that the appellant was treated for depression prior to service would be relevant only if VA needed to rebut the presumption of soundness.
1005|1005|1413417P151S4|1413417|4|151|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|This is not required here, as the presumption of soundness applies only when there is manifestation of a disease or injury during service.
1006|1006|1413417P151S5|1413417|5|151|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert v. Shinseki, 26 Vet. App. 48 (2012).
1007|1007|1413417P152S1|1413417|1|152|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In this case, the appellant was repeatedly found to be psychiatrically normal on the physical examinations during his active duty service.
1008|1008|1413417P152S2|1413417|2|152|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It is true that he reported having experienced nervousness or depression on several medical history surveys, but such notations were clarified by the medical officer to be referring to his hospitalization during college (that is prior to his active service).
1009|1009|1413417P152S3|1413417|3|152|False|False|EvidenceSentence|A September 1970 document indicates the hospitalization had occurred three years earlier, again, prior to active duty for training in 1969, and involved a situational depression following his father's death.
1010|1010|1413417P152S4|1413417|4|152|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The in-service examinations found the appellant to be psychiatrically normal, and the psychiatric evaluation in September 1970 found he was fit for duty, with no residual psychiatric defects.
1011|1011|1413417P152S5|1413417|5|152|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, there simply is no in-service manifestation of any psychiatric problem.
1012|1012|1413417P152S6|1413417|6|152|False|False|Sentence|Thus, without any in-service psychiatric manifestation, the presumption of soundness does not apply.

1014|1014|1413417P153S1|1413417|1|153|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Following service, the appellant has been treated for several psychiatric problems.
1015|1015|1413417P153S2|1413417|2|153|False|False|FindingSentence|However, no psychiatric disability has been shown to have begun during, been aggravated by, or have otherwise been caused by the appellant's brief military service.
1016|1016|1413417P153S3|1413417|3|153|False|False|ReasoningSentence|To this end, the appellant has not specifically identified any medical professional who has made such a connection; and the appellant lacks the training and experience to render such a nexus opinion himself.
1017|1017|1413417P153S4|1413417|4|153|False|False|CitationSentence|See Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).
1018|1018|1413417P154S1|1413417|1|154|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, the medical evidence of record suggests other causes for the appellant's current psychiatric impairment.
1019|1019|1413417P154S2|1413417|2|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In October 2010, the appellant underwent a psychological evaluation at which he reported feeling somewhat depressed and frustrated, asserting that he no longer enjoyed activities that he had previously.
1020|1020|1413417P154S3|1413417|3|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant was then hospitalized for two weeks in December 1990 and January 1991 for worsening depression and suicidal ideation.
1021|1021|1413417P154S4|1413417|4|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The discharge summary noted that the appellant had been experiencing increased pain secondary to a motor vehicle accident in 1988.
1022|1022|1413417P154S5|1413417|5|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that he had been treated in the 60s and 70s for depression and had received some outpatient treatment from 1974-76 following a 1973 motor vehicle accident.
1023|1023|1413417P154S6|1413417|6|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He was diagnosed with depression, chronic pain, and question of organic mood disorder secondary to brain injury.
1024|1024|1413417P154S7|1413417|7|154|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, there was no mention of the appellant's military service.
1025|1025|1413417P154S8|1413417|8|154|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, these records suggest a cause for the appellant's psychiatric impairment that is not related to his military service.
1026|1026|1413417P155S1|1413417|1|155|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In March 1991, a LCSW (Kurgans) noted that neuropsychological testing supported a finding that the appellant had a brain injury that in all likelihood occurred when he had his accident in April 1988.
1027|1027|1413417P155S2|1413417|2|155|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In December 1995, she again noted that the appellant had experienced chronic pain since a motor vehicle accident in 1988, and she suggested that this accident had led to diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and organic brain syndrome.
1028|1028|1413417P155S3|1413417|3|155|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She noted that the appellant had been seen for psychotherapy since 1990.
1029|1029|1413417P156S1|1413417|1|156|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant reported to her that he saw parallels between his military and post-military governmental experiences in that in both situations he did not receive sufficient support for his injuries.
1030|1030|1413417P156S2|1413417|2|156|False|False|Sentence|The appellant has asserted on several occasions that insufficient consideration was given to this statement.
1031|1031|1413417P156S3|1413417|3|156|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, what the appellant appears to be missing is that the LCSW was merely recording his contentions without lending them any medical endorsement; and, as discussed, the service treatment records do not support a finding of any psychiatric impairment during service.
1032|1032|1413417P156S4|1413417|4|156|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, while this report was considered, it does not suggest that a psychiatric disability is the result of the appellant's active duty or his active duty for training.
1033|1033|1413417P157S1|1413417|1|157|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The appellant's mother wrote in February 2002 that the appellant had gone to Virginia State College and then served in the U.S. Army.
1034|1034|1413417P157S2|1413417|2|157|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She asserted that he seemed to have problems dealing with stress since having gone into the service.
1035|1035|1413417P157S3|1413417|3|157|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, this statement does not specifically show the onset of psychiatric symptoms while the appellant was on active duty for training or active duty, or suggest that such service caused an acquired psychiatric disorder to develop.
1036|1036|1413417P158S1|1413417|1|158|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, like the appellant, his mother may be confused about what constitutes service.
1037|1037|1413417P158S2|1413417|2|158|False|False|ReasoningSentence|"It is quite understandable that a lay person might perceive either ROTC participation or inactive service while in the Army reserves (as the appellant had from January 1970 until he was separated from the reserves in April 1974) as constituting ""military service."""
1038|1038|1413417P158S3|1413417|3|158|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, as explained above, neither constitutes military service for the purpose of service connection.
1039|1039|1413417P158S4|1413417|4|158|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Here, the appellant was clearly hospitalized in college while in the ROTC.
1040|1040|1413417P158S4|1413417|4|158|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Likewise, the appellant may have experienced some psychiatric problems while still in the reserves in the wake of his motor vehicle accident in 1971 which caused significant physical limitation.
1041|1041|1413417P158S5|1413417|5|158|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, he was not on either active duty or active duty for training at either time, and therefore any psychiatric manifestations during those times would not warrant service connection.

1110|1110|1455333P32S2|1455333|2|32|False|False|EvidenceSentence|First, as previously stated, a February 2010 letter from a VA physician and a February 2010 VA treatment record together reflect that the Veteran has been diagnosed with PTSD in accordance with the DSM-IV.
1111|1111|1455333P32S3|1455333|3|32|False|False|EvidenceSentence|This diagnosis is confirmed throughout the Veteran's VA treatment records, including in VA treatment records dated October 2010, December 2010, April 2011, July 2011, October 2011, November 2011, January 2012, March 2012, May 2012, July 2012, August 2012, October 2012, December 2012, March 2013, and July 2013.
1112|1112|1455333P32S4|1455333|4|32|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Board finds that the Veteran's VA treatment records constitute probative evidence of a diagnosis of PTSD in accordance with the DSM-IV.

1114|1114|1455333P33S1|1455333|1|33|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Board notes that VA examination reports authored by the same clinician in February 2009 and April 2010 reflect the examiner's finding that, although the Veteran reported some symptoms consistent with a PTSD diagnosis, he did not report sufficient symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria for PTSD.
1115|1115|1455333P33S2|1455333|2|33|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, after weighing the probative value of the VA treatment records and the VA examination reports, the Board finds that the VA examination reports do not outweigh the VA treatment records on the issue of the Veteran's diagnosis of PTSD.
1116|1116|1455333P33S3|1455333|3|33|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Essentially, the VA examination reports' findings seem to differ from the VA treatment records' findings with regard to how the Veteran's reported symptoms were evaluated or interpreted.

1217|1217|1455570P42S3|1455570|3|42|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In 2012, the outpatient clinicians affirmatively diagnosed mild symptoms of depression and PTSD without conditional language, but again with little detailed analysis or rationale, referring to both physical disabilities as a cause for depression and combat events as causes for nightmares, intrusive memories, and irritability.
1218|1218|1455570P42S4|1455570|4|42|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, beginning in February 2013, VA treatment records reflect diagnoses of PTSD and major depressive disorder, and ongoing treatment for such disorders from the Veteran's treating psychiatrist, psychologist, and social worker.
1219|1219|1455570P42S5|1455570|5|42|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, the Veteran's testimony regarding a 2013 intensive mental health treatment program for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, which he reported had been related to his in-service combat stressors, is competent and credible in light of his ongoing treatment for such disorders.

1545|1545|1505726P74S2|1505726|2|74|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He brought an excerpt from his autobiography that he was writing which outlined negative attention (sexualized and otherwise) that he and other seamen had received upon joining the Blue Jackets Choir and the Drum and Bugle Corps in the Navy.

1549|1549|1505726P74S6|1505726|6|74|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA mental health consultation provides some evidence against the claim.
1550|1550|1505726P75S1|1505726|1|75|True|False|EvidenceSentence|A November 2008 VA infectious disease note observed that the Veteran's version of military experiences that day was different that those noted in the past.
1551|1551|1505726P75S2|1505726|2|75|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The VA provider noted that the Veteran's report of having 22,000 post-service sexual partners, consisting of partners 5 days a week for 35 years with up to 22 partners on a weekend seemed high, and that he appeared ""more interested in compensation"" than in dealing with his problems."
1552|1552|1505726P75S3|1505726|3|75|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA record provides some evidence against the PTSD claim.
1553|1553|1505726P76S1|1505726|1|76|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a June 2012 VA screen for PTSD was negative.

1555|1555|1505726P77S1|1505726|1|77|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Finally, the RO secured a September 2013 VA psychiatric examination and opinion with regard to the Veteran's PTSD claim.
1556|1556|1505726P77S2|1505726|2|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|This report discussed all of the medical and lay evidence of record in detail.
1557|1557|1505726P77S3|1505726|3|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist determined that the Veteran did not have a PTSD diagnosis that conforms to the DSM-IV criteria (A through E).

1560|1560|1505726P77S6|1505726|6|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He reported that his statements about homosexuality were coerced in the military and that he was instructed not to discuss the alleged rapes.
1561|1561|1505726P77S7|1505726|7|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also indicated that his anxiety problems and depressive symptoms began in 2005, when he began having panic attacks and temper problems due to co-worker difficulties, and in the context of other post-military stressors.
1562|1562|1505726P77S8|1505726|8|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA psychiatrist noted post-service life stressors, such as physical issues after a recent car accident; the recent death of his mother; the death of his younger brother; the loss of his job in 2005; the death of his father; his HIV treatment; and the loss of his business and partner in 1992.
1563|1563|1505726P77S9|1505726|9|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran described chronic difficulty with depression, anxiety, and insomnia.
1564|1564|1505726P78S1|1505726|1|78|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatrist also concluded that there is no objective evidence in service treatment records of any markers which would support claimed sexual traumas of harassment and physical rape or assault.
1565|1565|1505726P78S2|1505726|2|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|There was no evidence of negative performance reviews, demotions, disciplinary actions, AWOLs, or Article 15s.
1566|1566|1505726P78S3|1505726|3|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|There was no evidence of medical visits for physical injury or emotional distress noted in service treatment records.
1567|1567|1505726P78S4|1505726|4|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|His claim that his in-service statement about homosexuality was falsified could not be confirmed without resort to speculation.
1568|1568|1505726P78S5|1505726|5|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, the claimed stressor was not supported by objective evidence which will fulfill criterion A for PTSD.
1569|1569|1505726P78S6|1505726|6|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's written statement dated in August 1968 in service personnel records regarding homosexuality does not constitute evidence of reduced work performance on duty or any other pathology, as homosexuality in and of itself is not deemed a psychiatric or medical disorder.
1570|1570|1505726P78S7|1505726|7|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Therefore, the VA psychiatrist determined that the claimed stressor could not be verified or supported by the evidence, and thus does not meet criterion A for PTSD.
1571|1571|1505726P78S8|1505726|8|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, with regard to PTSD criteria B through F, the VA psychiatrist assessed that the Veteran did not meet the full criteria for PTSD in that there was no re-experiencing of the traumatic event, no persistent avoidance of stimuli, and no numbing of general responsiveness.
1572|1572|1505726P78S9|1505726|9|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The fact that he met his long-term partner during service is not indicative of the avoidance criteria that would be expected in the context of traumatic rape in the military.
1573|1573|1505726P78S10|1505726|10|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Rather, the Veteran's current psychiatric symptomatology was assessed as depressive disorder, NOS, along with a history of polysubstance abuse.
1574|1574|1505726P78S11|1505726|11|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|His cocaine abuse in 2005 was part of a period of post-service excessive stress, his personality disorder, and his lifestyle choices.

1576|1576|1505726P78S13|1505726|13|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was noted that the Veteran did well upon discharge from the military and held a job and a long-term love relationship for decades and did not seek out mental health care.
1577|1577|1505726P78S14|1505726|14|78|False|False|ReasoningSentence|His promiscuity is not a mental health disorder and is not in and of itself evidence of any claimed trauma.
1578|1578|1505726P79S1|1505726|1|79|True|False|FindingSentence|Upon review, in the present case, the Board finds that the most probative medical evidence weighs against a finding that the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with 38 C.F.R. Â§ 4.125(a) (i.e., DSM-IV) as a result of his alleged sexual assault stressors.
1579|1579|1505726P79S2|1505726|2|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Overall, the September 2013 VA psychiatric examination in particular was very thorough, supported by explanations, and considered the Veteran's history and relevant longitudinal complaints.
1580|1580|1505726P79S3|1505726|3|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|It also considered the lay and buddy statements of record.
1581|1581|1505726P79S4|1505726|4|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This VA opinion, supported also by the other evidence listed above, outweighs the findings of the April 2013 private psychological evaluation on the issue of whether the Veteran has a PTSD diagnosis in accordance with DSM-IV from alleged sexual assaults.
1582|1582|1505726P79S5|1505726|5|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|After an extensive interview and psychological testing, the VA examiner provided greater detail in assessing whether the Veteran met each of the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD than any other private or VA provider.
1583|1583|1505726P79S6|1505726|6|79|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The September 2013 VA psychiatric examiner also pointed out the Veteran's instances of exaggeration and other inaccuracies.
1584|1584|1505726P79S7|1505726|7|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|In several instances, the Veteran was prone to exaggeration when testing for PTSD symptomatology.

1593|1593|1505726P81S1|1505726|1|81|True|False|ReasoningSentence|That notwithstanding, in the instant case, the Board has found the Veteran's lay statements are less probative than the post-service medical evidence finding that the Veteran does not meet the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, based on alleged in-service sexual assaults.
1594|1594|1505726P81S2|1505726|2|81|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The overall evidence of record is not supportive of behavioral changes showing that these assaults actually occurred.
1595|1595|1505726P81S3|1505726|3|81|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Federal Circuit has held that the Board can favor competent medical evidence over lay statements offered by the Veteran, as long as the Board neither deems lay evidence categorically incompetent nor improperly requires a medical opinion as the sole way to prove causation.

1599|1599|1505726P82S2|1505726|2|82|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board has weighed the evidence of record to make a determination whether the occurrence of the alleged stressor was sufficiently corroborated, to include evidence of a reported assault and behavior changes in service records, VA opinions, private opinions, lay statements, and VA treatment evidence.
1600|1600|1505726P82S3|1505726|3|82|False|False|FindingSentence|In other words, the Board has considered all available evidence relevant to the Veteran's attempt to corroborate the occurrence of the alleged sexual assault stressors, but has found that insufficient credible, probative evidence that these sexual assaults actually occurred.
1601|1601|1505726P83S1|1505726|1|83|True|False|FindingSentence|Although the Veteran is entitled to the benefit of the doubt where the evidence is in approximate balance, the benefit of the doubt doctrine is inapplicable where, as here, the preponderance of the evidence is service connection for PTSD.

1605|1605|1505726P86S1|1505726|1|86|True|False|Sentence|The Board has considered whether the Veteran's PTSD claim raised the issue of whether service connection is warranted for any other acquired psychiatric disorder in addition to PTSD.

1612|1612|1505726P87S6|1505726|6|87|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, in the present case, the Board cannot limit its analysis of the Veteran's claim solely to PTSD.
1613|1613|1505726P87S7|1505726|7|87|False|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, his claim potentially encompasses psychiatric conditions other than PTSD that are reasonably raised by the record.
1614|1614|1505726P88S1|1505726|1|88|True|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, upon review of the evidence of record, Board finds that the Veteran is not entitled to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder other than PTSD.

1637|1637|1505726P92S3|1505726|3|92|False|False|EvidenceSentence|These behaviors in and of themselves are not proof of any formal psychiatric disorder in pre-military; he was not diagnosed or formally treated for any specific psychiatric disorder prior to military.
1638|1638|1505726P92S4|1505726|4|92|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Behaviors most likely relate to beginning examples of maladaptive choices which later progressed to styles consistent with Personality disorder.
1639|1639|1505726P92S5|1505726|5|92|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Enlistment papers showed complaints of mild anxiety pre-military, however, subjective mild anxiety is not an indication of formal mental disorder.
1640|1640|1505726P92S6|1505726|6|92|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Likewise, he has variably reported bisexual and homosexual tendencies prior to military, but these lifestyle choices regarding sexual orientation are not specific to any diagnosable mental disorder per DSM-IV.
1641|1641|1505726P92S7|1505726|7|92|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, since no specific formal diagnosis existed premilitary, no exacerbation statement is deemed necessary with regard to post military diagnoses rendered below.

1754|1754|1514004P40S2|1514004|2|40|False|False|EvidenceSentence|His symptoms have been variously diagnosed but primarily as PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder.
1755|1755|1514004P41S1|1514004|1|41|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Initially, and to the extent that PTSD has noted to have preexisted service and/or attributed to childhood trauma, to include on VA examination in December 1992 and November 2010, the Board notes that a January 1964 Reserve examination report reflects psychiatric examination was normal.

1762|1762|1514004P43S1|1514004|1|43|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, and although a March 1971 VA treatment record notes inpatient treatment in 1967 with long standing anxiety symptoms diagnosed as chronic anxiety state, the May 1968 active duty service entrance examination report shows psychiatric examination.
1763|1763|1514004P43S2|1514004|2|43|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"In addition, and although psychiatric impairment was noted, the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, and his neuropsychiatric status was assigned a profile of ""1."" "
1764|1764|1514004P43S3|1514004|3|43|False|False|FindingSentence|In light of these contradictory findings, and having reviewed the record, the Board concludes that there is not clear and unmistakable evidence that a psychiatric disorder existed prior to service entrance.
1765|1765|1514004P43S4|1514004|4|43|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Veteran is presumed to have been in sound condition when entering service as to a psychiatric disorder.
1766|1766|1514004P44S1|1514004|1|44|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Service records tend to show that at least psychiatric symptoms manifested during service.
1767|1767|1514004P44S2|1514004|2|44|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Following his deployment to Vietnam in September 1968, he was accompanied by a recommendation for limited duty and deployment only to a location where psychiatric outpatient treatment was available.

1770|1770|1514004P45S2|1514004|2|45|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the June 1969 separation examination report shows psychiatric evaluation was normal, on the accompanying medical history the Veteran indicated that he had depression or excessive worry, memory loss, and nervous trouble.

1772|1772|1514004P47S1|1514004|1|47|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Consistent with the November 2010 VA examiner's opinion is the opinion of the July 2011 private physician who determined that the Veteran meets the criteria for not only a diagnosis of PTSD but also generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).
1773|1773|1514004P47S2|1514004|2|47|False|False|EvidenceSentence| Both the July 2011 private report and the December 1992 VA examination report conclude that the most traumatic circumstance of the Veteran's Vietnam service was related to the Veteran not being permitted to carry a gun due to his psychiatric disorder.
1774|1774|1514004P48S1|1514004|1|48|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The private report states that the Veteran felt terrified and feared for his life the entire time he was serving in Vietnam.

1776|1776|1514004P48S3|1514004|3|48|False|False|FindingSentence|Based on this new July 2011 private treatment report, in conjunction with the other evidence of record, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise as to whether the Veteran has PTSD and generalized anxiety disorder related to service.
1777|1777|1514004P49S1|1514004|1|49|True|False|FindingSentence|Resolving reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor, the Board finds the evidence is in favor of the claim.

The Veteran's diagnosed PTSD, major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder did not begin during her military service and are not otherwise related to service, to include as a result of her verified in-service stressor; the evidence similarly fails to establish that an Axis I acquired psychiatric disability was aggravated during her military service.

1810|1810|1514581P39S2|1514581|2|39|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Yet, it is the relationship between service and the current disability, if any, that is at issue here, and it is the delayed onset, typical with PTSD, that complicates the relevant analysis for decision-makers and health care providers alike.
1811|1811|1514581P40S1|1514581|1|40|True|False|Sentence|So, the Board next turns to the occurrence of military stressors.
1812|1812|1514581P40S2|1514581|2|40|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The credible supporting evidence required to establish an in-service stressor depends upon the nature of the stressor.

1850|1850|1514581P49S1|1514581|1|49|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|Owing to the unique character of mental health illness, and attendant complexity of neurological and psychological pathology, the Court has acknowledged delayed-onset PTSD.
1851|1851|1514581P49S2|1514581|2|49|False|False|CitationSentence|"See Young v. McDonald, 766 F.3d 1348, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (""'Because of the complexity of PTSD. . .PTSD can occur hours, months, or years after a military stressor.'"")."
1852|1852|1514581P49S3|1514581|3|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|A retrospective review of the record may well allow a mental healthcare provider to conclude that earlier events caused or aggravated subsequently diagnosed PTSD.
1853|1853|1514581P49S4|1514581|4|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Even so, that is not the case here.
1854|1854|1514581P49S5|1514581|5|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, such a conclusion need not necessarily be based on contemporaneous symptoms but, instead, on clinical expertise, informed by developments over a veteran's lifetime.
1855|1855|1514581P49S6|1514581|6|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Consequently, as the possible aggravation was not associated with contemporaneous manifestation, the Board affords this statement little, if any, weight in its final resolution of the instant matter.
1856|1856|1514581P50S1|1514581|1|50|True|False|FindingSentence|In fact, VA examiners, in applying clinical judgment to the record, have consistently declined to draw the conclusion and the Veteran has not shown-to the at least as likely as not standard-that her PTSD manifested in service.
1857|1857|1514581P50S2|1514581|2|50|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As a VA examiner in June 2013 explained, after a comprehensive review of the record and recitation of pertinent facts, the service treatment records repeatedly rule out diagnosis of any psychiatric disability.
1858|1858|1514581P50S3|1514581|3|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As detailed in the Board's now vacated decisions, the record shows that the Veteran was evaluated during service by psychiatric services.
1859|1859|1514581P50S4|1514581|4|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was first evaluated by the Chaplin/Family Advocacy Officer at a mental health services clinic in December 1985.
1860|1860|1514581P50S5|1514581|5|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Mental status examination at that time was within normal limits, and the medical officer indicated that no diagnosis was warranted.
1861|1861|1514581P50S6|1514581|6|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Subsequent entries in January and March 1986, showed that her records were screened for reassignment by mental health services, but again there was no indication of any mental health problems.
1862|1862|1514581P50S7|1514581|7|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was again found to be medically eligible for retention in March 1986.
1863|1863|1514581P50S8|1514581|8|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was also seen by psychiatric services in June 1990, shortly before separation, with the notation of no diagnosis in the record.
1864|1864|1514581P50S9|1514581|9|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Likewise, the Veteran was found psychiatrically normal in the Report of Medical Examination at separation in July 1990.
1865|1865|1514581P51S1|1514581|1|51|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, there is no evidence of symptoms attributed at the time, or in retrospect by a health care provider, to PTSD.
1866|1866|1514581P51S2|1514581|2|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Other than a single entry in June 1990, shortly before her discharge from service, the service treatment records showed no complaints or abnormalities related to any psychiatric problems during service.
1867|1867|1514581P51S3|1514581|3|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding the June 1990 entry, the service records show that the Veteran was seen by psychiatric services for stress and for evaluation of extreme gullibility and low self-esteem.
1868|1868|1514581P51S4|1514581|4|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|No specific findings were reported and, again, the diagnosis on Axis I was no diagnosis.
1869|1869|1514581P51S5|1514581|5|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At the April 2011 Travel Board hearing, the Veteran submitted a letter from a fellow soldier who recalled a time when the Veteran was sad and distant.
1870|1870|1514581P51S6|1514581|6|51|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Yet, on a July 1990 Report of Medical History at separation from service, the Veteran specifically denied any history of trouble sleeping, depression or excess worry, memory problems or nervous trouble of any sort.
1871|1871|1514581P52S1|1514581|1|52|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran also acknowledged in her February 2007 VA examination and April 2011 Travel Board hearing that she did not have any psychiatric problems during service and she denied seeking any psychiatric treatment, including at the time of discharge from service.
1872|1872|1514581P52S2|1514581|2|52|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no showing that the Veteran had PTSD or symptoms attributable to PTSD, during service.
1873|1873|1514581P53S1|1514581|1|53|True|False|EvidenceSentence|As an alternative to diagnosis or obvious symptoms of PTSD in service, the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and behavioral problems in service, purportedly indicative of PTSD.
1874|1874|1514581P53S2|1514581|2|53|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Board recognizes that not every deficiency or failure to succeed is the hallmark of mental health illness.
1875|1875|1514581P53S3|1514581|3|53|False|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that a clinical diagnosis is warranted, such a determination is, again, soundly within the purview of a mental healthcare provider.
1876|1876|1514581P54S1|1514581|1|54|True|False|EvidenceSentence|A review of her Airman Performance Reports showed that in her first year of service (September 1985 to September 1986), the Veteran received an overall rating of 7 by her supervisor (on a scale of zero to nine).
1877|1877|1514581P54S2|1514581|2|54|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The evaluation report indicated that the Veteran had progressed at a slow but satisfactory rate, that she needed constant supervision, and that she lacked the ability to grasp both the practical and technical aspects of her job.
1878|1878|1514581P54S3|1514581|3|54|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to E-3 by her commanding officer in December 1986, based on her supervisor's recommendation that she was not progressing in a satisfactory manner and did not pay attention to detail.
1879|1879|1514581P55S1|1514581|1|55|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran's next two annual performance evaluations (1986 to 1987 and 1987 to 1988) showed marked improvement in her duty performance and attitude, and she was given an overall score on nine on both reports.
1880|1880|1514581P55S2|1514581|2|55|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, her evaluations from September 1988 to September 1989, and September 1989 to March 1990, showed that her quality of work steadily deteriorated and was inconsistent and unpredictable.
1881|1881|1514581P55S3|1514581|3|55|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was counseled numerous times on the condition both of her dormitory room and of her uniform and on her personal hygiene, with little or no improvement.
1882|1882|1514581P55S4|1514581|4|55|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She had angry outbursts at work and in the dormitory which alienated the Veteran from her peers, and despite financial counseling regarding several overdue accounts at various local businesses, she continued to spend to excess.
1883|1883|1514581P55S5|1514581|5|55|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was not recommended for promotion to sergeant in October 1989 but was subsequently recommended and promoted to E-5 in February 1990.
1884|1884|1514581P55S6|1514581|6|55|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in July 1990, the Veteran's commanding officer recommended that the Veteran's appointment (promotion) be vacated.
1885|1885|1514581P56S1|1514581|1|56|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In a letter to her senior rating supervisor (Command Sergeant Major) dated in July 1990, the Veteran wrote that she realized that she had not performed as well as she could have in the past six months because of serious financial and personal problems, but that she believed that she had finally straightened things out and wanted to continue her military career.
1886|1886|1514581P57S1|1514581|1|57|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The service records showed that the Veteran was AWOL on the day she was seen at the mental health clinic in June 1990 and that she subsequently received nonjudicial punishment (Article 15) for her actions, which included punching a hole in a wall.
1887|1887|1514581P57S2|1514581|2|57|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was given a general discharge from service in August 1990, based on a pattern of misconduct during service that, in addition to her Article 15, included dereliction of duty, writing a bad check, and failing a dormitory inspection.
1888|1888|1514581P58S1|1514581|1|58|True|False|ReasoningSentence|To the extent that the Veteran has now alleged that she did experience psychiatric problems-however manifest-during service, the Board finds that she lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of PTSD.
1889|1889|1514581P58S2|1514581|2|58|False|False|CitationSentence|"See Young, 766 F.3d at 1353 (""PTSD is not the type of medical condition that lay evidence, standing alone, is competent and sufficient to identify."
1890|1890|1514581P58S3|1514581|3|58|False|False|Sentence|"'Because of the complexity of PTSD, the application of careful clinical judgment is necessary to identify and describe the relationship between past events and current symptoms.'"")."
1891|1891|1514581P59S1|1514581|1|59|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In June 2013, the VA examiner reviewed the records showing that the Veteran had a repeated pattern of misconduct during military service.
1892|1892|1514581P59S2|1514581|2|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Critically, she indicated that the pattern was a result of her diagnosed personality disorder and was not associated with her later diagnosis of PTSD.
1893|1893|1514581P59S3|1514581|3|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner explained that the Veteran's service treatment records did not show any mention of symptoms of anxiety as a result of her stressful experiences as a photographer, and there was nothing to associate her misconduct with the photography.
1894|1894|1514581P59S4|1514581|4|59|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner noted that the Veteran's performance difficulties occurred as early as 1986, not long after she entered the military.
1895|1895|1514581P59S5|1514581|5|59|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds this compelling opinion and rationale most probative of the issue regarding the absence of manifest PTSD in service.
1896|1896|1514581P60S1|1514581|1|60|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|As was explained, absent a finding that a pre-service disease or injury manifested or was incurred in service, the presumption of soundness is not for application.
1897|1897|1514581P60S2|1514581|2|60|False|False|CitationSentence|See Gilbert, 26 Vet. App. at 54.
1898|1898|1514581P60S3|1514581|3|60|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Of note, in Gilbert, as here, the Veteran was diagnosed with an acquired psychiatric disability post-service, but the diagnosis was not rendered during service and there was no indication that the disability had onset or was present during service.
1899|1899|1514581P60S4|1514581|4|60|False|False|ReasoningSentence|In Gilbert, the Veteran complained of several incidents in service which he believed caused his psychiatric disability.
1900|1900|1514581P60S5|1514581|5|60|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, the Court explained that in such a circumstance, the presumption of soundness did not attach.
1901|1901|1514581P61S1|1514581|1|61|True|False|FindingSentence|As such, even though the Veteran has, since service, identified in-service stressors which could support a PTSD diagnosis, the evidence does not show an in-service manifestation of PTSD.
1902|1902|1514581P61S2|1514581|2|61|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Simple concession of a military stressor does not constitute manifestation of disease, as that is only one of many criteria that must combine into a diagnosis of PTSD.
1903|1903|1514581P61S3|1514581|3|61|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the presumption of soundness is not for application in this case.
1904|1904|1514581P62S1|1514581|1|62|True|False|Sentence|B.
1905|1905|1514581P63S1|1514581|1|63|True|False|Sentence|The analysis does not stop there, as it must now be determined whether the evidence of record makes it at least as likely as not that the Veteran's PTSD-though not manifest during-was nonetheless either caused or aggravated by her military service.
1906|1906|1514581P63S2|1514581|2|63|False|False|FindingSentence|As noted above, the occurrence of the Veteran's in-service stressor events are credibly supported in the record.
1907|1907|1514581P63S3|1514581|3|63|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, a VA examiner in June 2013 acknowledged that the Veteran's photographing of horrific and traumatic sights in the military was adequate to support criterion A of a PTSD diagnosis.
1908|1908|1514581P64S1|1514581|1|64|True|False|Sentence|However, the question still remains whether the Veteran's later-diagnosed PTSD is the result of an in-service stressor.
1909|1909|1514581P64S2|1514581|2|64|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Weighing against the Veteran's claim are service treatment records which are absent for any diagnosis for PTSD, as previously detailed.
1910|1910|1514581P64S3|1514581|3|64|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Although the Veteran pointed to a number of outbursts and problems in service, the medical evidence of record does not actually show that associated PTSD was ever diagnosed, despite the fact that these behavioral problems were well-known.
1911|1911|1514581P65S1|1514581|1|65|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also appreciates that the Veteran did not seek mental health treatment and was not diagnosed with PTSD for more than a decade after service.
1912|1912|1514581P65S2|1514581|2|65|False|False|ReasoningSentence|These post-service treatment records weigh against a finding of a link between the currently diagnosed PTSD and the in-service stressor events.
1913|1913|1514581P65S3|1514581|3|65|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran reported first initiating contact with a mental health professional in June 2002, at which time she related that she had been depressed since February 2002 when she left her wife to be involved in an ""alternative lifestyle."""

1929|1929|1514581P69S2|1514581|2|69|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The assessment does not identify the nature of the military stressor and provides no rationale or analysis of the PTSD criteria.

1942|1942|1514581P71S5|1514581|5|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He noted that the Veteran's memory seemed somewhat selective and that while she had a vague memory of some of the incidents from her youth, it could also be a pattern of her communication or possibly due to amnesic episodes to dissociative disorder; all of which could be consistent with PTSD.
1943|1943|1514581P71S6|1514581|6|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner ultimately diagnosed PTSD, at least as likely as not from childhood abuse.
1944|1944|1514581P72S1|1514581|1|72|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Thereafter, she continued to seek VA psychiatric treatment approximately once per month, the focus of which predominantly related to her childhood abuse.

1948|1948|1514581P72S5|1514581|5|72|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran thought that she had PTSD because she is constantly worried about life in general, was irritable and angry, and has flashbacks from her childhood, nightmares, and difficulty sleeping.

1957|1957|1514581P74S4|1514581|4|74|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The assessment at that time was gender identity disorder, with questionable history of sub-syndromal PTSD.

1966|1966|1514581P76S2|1514581|2|76|False|False|EvidenceSentence|As noted, the examiner acknowledged that the Veteran's verified in-service stressors could support a diagnosis of PTSD.
1967|1967|1514581P76S3|1514581|3|76|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, she found that in the case of this particular Veteran, the events she experienced in the military, although upsetting and stressful, did not appear to be medically sufficient to cause all or part of her particular PTSD.
1968|1968|1514581P77S1|1514581|1|77|True|False|ReasoningSentence|This assessment is relatively consistent with the VA treatment records detailed above.
1969|1969|1514581P77S2|1514581|2|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner observed that as had been stated by both the Veteran and her treatment providers, the Veteran's PTSD and its expressed symptoms primarily pertained to her severe childhood abuse.
1970|1970|1514581P77S3|1514581|3|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the examiner found that the content of the Veteran's re-experiencing symptoms was predominately related to childhood traumas, and there were no avoidance or hyperarousal symptoms described in treatment notes or other documentation that would be relatable to these traumatic events in the military.
1971|1971|1514581P77S4|1514581|4|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner also observed that more recently, the Veteran had discussed the 1997 car accident in which her fiancÃ©e died.

1973|1973|1514581P77S6|1514581|6|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She also discontinued treatment because discussing this event was triggering memories and anxiety about childhood abuse.
1974|1974|1514581P78S1|1514581|1|78|True|False|Sentence|In September 2013, the Veteran's representative argued that the VA examiner had erred by stating that the records do not demonstrate a military stressor that would account for the majority of the symptoms presentation, or that this constituted the bulk of treatment focus, in that the examiner appeared to conclude that it was an all or nothing debate.
1975|1975|1514581P78S2|1514581|2|78|False|False|Sentence|"The representative suggested that under the liberal at least as likely as not standard there is no need to demonstrate that a ""bulk"" of the problem or a ""majority"" of the treatment focused only on the service stressors."
1976|1976|1514581P78S3|1514581|3|78|False|False|Sentence|The representative acknowledged that the Veteran had readily stated that her childhood trauma was aggravated by the military stressors.
1977|1977|1514581P78S4|1514581|4|78|False|False|Sentence|Yet, the representative suggested that the VA examiner had failed to discuss the aspect of the conceded trauma dealing with the documentation of child abuse victims during service and whether this one aspect of the military stressor more than any other could have resurfaced the Veteran's childhood traumas-even now hidden amongst the discussion of her own childhood traumas.
1978|1978|1514581P79S1|1514581|1|79|True|False|Sentence|The Board has considered this argument and concurs that an in-service stressor need not be the predominant (that is bulk or majority) cause of PTSD.
1979|1979|1514581P79S2|1514581|2|79|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the examiner found that the witnessing of traumatic events, such as the ones photographed by the Veteran during service, would be sufficient to establish Criterion A, the examiner explained that in the Veteran's case, the evidence did not demonstrate that the Veteran met Criterion B (symptoms of reexperiencing) or C and D (symptoms of avoidance and hyperarousal) under the DSM-IV for PTSD as a result of the in-service experiences.
1980|1980|1514581P79S3|1514581|3|79|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The VA examiner explained that the symptoms of reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal that the Veteran experienced, and which formed the basis of her PTSD diagnosis, were associated with childhood abuse and her fiancÃ©e's death in 1997-not with the Veteran's experiences in service.
1981|1981|1514581P79S4|1514581|4|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|"Moreover, although the representative had suggested that the examiner failed to use the ""at least as likely as not standard,"" the June 2013 VA examination report directly contradicts this assertion as the examiner specifically opined that the Veteran's PTSD was ""less likely than not"" incurred in or caused by the confirmed in-service stressors."
1982|1982|1514581P79S5|1514581|5|79|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that June 2013 VA medical opinion to be highly probative on the question of a possible nexus to service.

1995|1995|1514581P82S1|1514581|1|82|True|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the Board notes that the Veteran has made numerous inconsistent and contradictory statements regarding the nature, extent, and severity of her psychiatric symptoms during the pendency of this appeal, revising her statements in an attempt to associate her current psychiatric problems to her time in service.
1996|1996|1514581P82S2|1514581|2|82|False|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, at her Board hearing the Veteran testified that she never sought psychiatric counseling in service because she did not think that she had any problems.
1997|1997|1514581P82S3|1514581|3|82|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Yet, in a conflicting statement, she also stated that she did not seek treatment in service because she would have lost her security clearance.

2000|2000|1514581P83S3|1514581|3|83|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, after a meticulous review of all of the medical treatment records of record, the Board has not found a single complaint or report of hypervigilance or panic attacks.
2001|2001|1514581P83S4|1514581|4|83|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the March 2012 JMR failed to identify any such symptoms.
2002|2002|1514581P84S1|1514581|1|84|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Similarly, while the Veteran testified that she had vivid, recurring nightmares, and flashbacks related specifically to her experiences in service four-to-five times per week, she did not describe any such symptoms related to service when examined by VA in 2007.
2003|2003|1514581P84S2|1514581|2|84|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"Most of the treatment records indicated that she gave a ""vague"" description of her nightmares and flashbacks."
2004|2004|1514581P84S3|1514581|3|84|False|False|EvidenceSentence|On the few occasions when she did describe her nightmares and flashbacks, the Veteran reported that they were about the abuse she suffered and witnessed as a child and the death of her fiancÃ©e.
2005|2005|1514581P85S1|1514581|1|85|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Furthermore, although the Veteran was treated for psychiatric problems on numerous occasions since May 2005, as described above, she never mentioned any symptoms or problems related to her service experiences as a photographer until one and a half years later (see November 2006 treatment note), coincident with her September 2006 claim for same.
2006|2006|1514581P85S2|1514581|2|85|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Even during July 2007 treatment, the Veteran did not relate her current psychiatric problems to any incident in service and said only that when she heard a child cry, it reminded her of the child she photographed in service, who had been abused.

2008|2008|1514581P85S4|1514581|4|85|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that the Veteran would recognize that she had PTSD or some symptoms of PTSD in 2002, which she believed to be related to service, but did not report any such symptoms as being related to service until some four years later, and 18 months after documented psychiatric treatment-instead detailing prior and subsequent unrelated stressors-strains credibility.
2009|2009|1514581P85S5|1514581|5|85|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Even looking at the Veteran's efforts at VA examinations, it was noted at the February 2007 VA examination that the Veteran was quick to endorse items, apparently trying to make herself look more disturbed than she was, thereby suggesting a willingness to inaccurately discuss her medical symptomatology.
2010|2010|1514581P86S1|1514581|1|86|True|False|Sentence|The Board now turns to aggravation of PTSD by military stressors.
2011|2011|1514581P86S2|1514581|2|86|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As previously indicated, the February 2007 VA examination resulted in the possibility of aggravation-too equivocal to establish the requisite nexus.
2012|2012|1514581P86S3|1514581|3|86|False|False|Sentence|Nevertheless, because this examination had allowed for the possibility that the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disability had been aggravated by her military service, the Board, as directed by the July 2014 JMR, obtained a medical opinion to investigation the possibility of this association.
2013|2013|1514581P87S1|1514581|1|87|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In November 2014 the same examiner who completed the June 2013 examination addressed the question of whether the Veteran's military experiences aggravated his childhood based PTSD.
2014|2014|1514581P87S2|1514581|2|87|False|False|EvidenceSentence|After fully reviewing the evidence of record, the examiner concluded that an opinion regarding aggravation of PTSD based on the impact of conceded traumas in service could not be rendered without resort to mere speculation.
2015|2015|1514581P87S3|1514581|3|87|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She explained that without documentation of any medical disorder or associated symptoms at any time prior to military service-symptoms which the Veteran herself denied appreciating even through her military service-there is no way to specify if traumatic memories of the military experiences were associated with a permanent worsening of the Veteran's PTSD.
2016|2016|1514581P87S4|1514581|4|87|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also noted that there was no baseline level of functioning found in the available medical evidence, upon which to base a conclusion that a condition had been aggravated.
2017|2017|1514581P88S1|1514581|1|88|True|False|ReasoningSentence|As explained by the examiner, the record does not provide a basis upon which to render a principled assessment regarding aggravation.
2018|2018|1514581P88S2|1514581|2|88|False|False|ReasoningSentence|A medical opinion cannot be compelled where a health care provider has specifically identified the information necessary to render a clinical determination and has yet deemed the available information insufficient-or entirely absent.
2019|2019|1514581P88S3|1514581|3|88|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Neither the Veteran nor the record identifies or suggests any source of relevant evidence that might aid in a determination.
2020|2020|1514581P88S4|1514581|4|88|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board appreciates the complexity of such a determination on the sparsity of the available record and fully credits the VA examiner's explanation.
2021|2021|1514581P88S5|1514581|5|88|False|False|CitationSentence|See Jones v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 382, 391 (2010) (stating a VA medical examination is not inadequate merely because the medical examiner states he or she cannot reach a conclusion without resort to speculation and the duty to assist does not extend to requiring a VA physician to render an opinion beyond what may reasonably be concluded from the procurable medical evidence).
2022|2022|1514581P88S6|1514581|6|88|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the examiner's conclusion is fully adequate and is not rendered inadequate solely on the grounds that the examiner stated that she could not form an opinion without resorting to speculation.
2023|2023|1514581P89S1|1514581|1|89|True|False|ReasoningSentence|For the reasons discussed above, the Board finds that the Veteran's alleged symptoms regarding her service experiences are self-serving and are not credible.
2024|2024|1514581P89S2|1514581|2|89|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Moreover, after taking into account the Veteran's reported history of symptomatology, the June 2013 VA examiner offered a highly probative medical opinion that the Veteran's PTSD was due to her childhood abuse and death of her fiancÃ©e.
2025|2025|1514581P89S3|1514581|3|89|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Additionally, while the Veteran was treated by several other psychiatrists over the years, most of those reports indicate that her current psychiatric problems were related to her childhood abuse.
2026|2026|1514581P90S1|1514581|1|90|True|False|FindingSentence|The Board has considered whether the evidence supports a finding that the Veteran's PTSD was aggravated by her in-service experiences, but finds that there is not sufficient evidence to meet the relative equipoise standard.
2027|2027|1514581P90S2|1514581|2|90|False|False|ReasoningSentence|That is, the absence of evidence to the contrary does not render it at least as likely as not that a psychiatric disability was aggravated, particularly when, as here, the is overwhelming evidence that the Veteran's psychiatric disability is attributable to non-service related situations.
2028|2028|1514581P91S1|1514581|1|91|True|False|FindingSentence|In conclusion, the preponderance of evidence establishes that the Veteran was diagnosed with PTSD years after service, based on pre- and post-service stressors, with no manifestation of PTSD during service.
2029|2029|1514581P91S2|1514581|2|91|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Consequently, the burden of proof, by any degree, has not been shifted to VA.
2030|2030|1514581P91S3|1514581|3|91|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Second, while the Veteran's duties as a photographer in service have been found to meet a single criterion for a diagnosis of PTSD, the remaining criteria have not been found by mental health professionals to be so met, in relation specifically to any military stressor.
2031|2031|1514581P91S4|1514581|4|91|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, there is no supported and significantly probative evidence of diagnosed PTSD directly caused by the Veteran's active service.
2032|2032|1514581P91S5|1514581|5|91|False|False|Sentence|Last, pursuant to the July 2014 JMR, VA most recently sought an opinion as to whether military service yet aggravated the Veteran's PTSD, in light of suggested possibility.
2033|2033|1514581P91S6|1514581|6|91|False|False|ReasoningSentence|While the burden of proof remains on the Veteran to at least balance the evidence for and against her claim, the VA examiner's reasoned opinion that the issue of aggravation cannot be resolved without resort to mere speculation provides no weight or counterweight at all, as the absence of evidence does not move the evidentiary scales.
2034|2034|1514581P91S7|1514581|7|91|False|False|FindingSentence|There is no credible and probative medical evidence to establish that military service aggravated PTSD diagnosed fifteen years later.
2035|2035|1514581P92S1|1514581|1|92|True|False|FindingSentence|Based on the evidence of record, both lay and medical, the Board finds that the weight of the evidence is against a finding of relationship between the Veteran's currently diagnosed PTSD and her corroborated in-service stressor events.
2036|2036|1514581P92S2|1514581|2|92|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board finds that a preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim for service connection for PTSD, and the claim must be denied.

2038|2038|1514581P94S1|1514581|1|94|True|False|FindingSentence|The evidence of record demonstrates that, in addition to PTSD, the Veteran has also been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders during the pendency of this appeal, to include: major depressive disorder, gender identity disorder, and personality disorder.
2039|2039|1514581P94S2|1514581|2|94|False|False|FindingSentence|However, the totality of the competent medical evidence does not show that these conditions began during or were otherwise caused by the Veteran's military service.
2040|2040|1514581P95S1|1514581|1|95|True|False|FindingSentence|As noted in the previous section, there is no indication that the Veteran had any psychiatric problems either in service or for more than a decade after service.
2041|2041|1514581P95S2|1514581|2|95|False|False|ReasoningSentence|When first seeking treatment in June 2002, tellingly, the Veteran did not relate her depression to service but, instead, stated that it began when she left her wife to be involved in an alternative lifestyle.
2042|2042|1514581P95S3|1514581|3|95|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran did not follow-up on treatment until May 2005, when she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and the focus of treatment was primarily related to her ex-wife.

2044|2044|1514581P96S2|1514581|2|96|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In a November 2006 VA outpatient clinic note, the Veteran reported the death of her fiancÃ© in 1997 and mentioned in-service photos of disturbing images.
2045|2045|1514581P96S3|1514581|3|96|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At that time, she was having problems with sleep, concentration, depression, nightmares, and anger, which she was said began at age ten.
2046|2046|1514581P96S4|1514581|4|96|False|False|EvidenceSentence|During private psychiatric assessment in December 2006, the Veteran reported that she had felt depressed since 1986, when she was placed on medical administrative hold pending evaluation of a pre-existing ear disorder.
2047|2047|1514581P96S5|1514581|5|96|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, with no comment regarding origin.

2334|2334|1526599P59S1|1526599|1|59|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the July 2012 VA examination report and opinion outweighs the diagnoses of PTSD following evaluations by VA staff psychologists in April 2006 and March 2008, as well as by VA nurse practitioners in July 2012, August 2012, and November 2012.
2335|2335|1526599P59S2|1526599|2|59|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Specifically, the July 2012 examiner conducted a comprehensive review of the Veteran's psychiatric history as well as treatment records and evaluations, addressing evidence dated from 2000 to 2012, to include past diagnoses of PTSD.

2408|2408|1534347P36S2|1534347|2|36|False|False|EvidenceSentence|More specifically, an October 1984 consultation sheet states that the Veteran was referred by his school to a psychiatrist at age 16 and that he received treatment for two years.
2409|2409|1534347P36S3|1534347|3|36|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, a March 2006 letter from a community mental health clinic confirms that the Veteran participated in an intake assessment at the clinic in November 1979 and that his file was closed in January 1981.

2414|2414|1534347P37S3|1534347|3|37|False|False|EvidenceSentence|For example, in the February 1998 VA examination report, the VA examiner diagnosed the Veteran with major depression with psychotic features and stated that the Veteran described symptoms of major depression during service.

2418|2418|1534347P37S7|1534347|7|37|False|False|FindingSentence|Therefore, the second element of service connection is established and benefits may not be deducted on the basis of evidence of pre-existence of an acquired psychiatric disorder.

2420|2420|1534347P38S1|1534347|1|38|True|False|FindingSentence|As to the first and third elements of service connection, the Veteran has consistently been diagnosed with acquired psychiatric disorders since he was in service and throughout the pendency of this claim.
2421|2421|1534347P38S2|1534347|2|38|False|False|EvidenceSentence|More specifically, the diagnoses of PTSD and/or depression are noted in service treatment records (when he was his spouse's dependent) dated September 1992 and October 1992; letters from private physicians dated  November 1993, January 1998, January 2002, and March 2002; and VA treatment records dated February 1998; March and August 2001; March, April, June, July, and December 2002; September and October 2003; February and September 2004; January, April, August, and October 2005; January, February, April, July, and November 2006; January, June, and September 2007; January and May 2008; April, May, July, September, and December 2010; January 2011; March, April, June, August, and October 2012; January, April, July, August, October, and November 2013; January, February, April, June, August, September, October, and December 2014; and January and March 2015, as well as many others.
2422|2422|1534347P38S3|1534347|3|38|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the Veteran has a current diagnosis of an acquired psychiatric disorder and it has been continuously treated since his time in service.
2423|2423|1534347P38S4|1534347|4|38|False|False|FindingSentence|A nexus between the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder and his period of active service is likewise established with the findings of aggravation reflected in the September 2004 letter from the Veteran's VA physician.
2424|2424|1534347P38S5|1534347|5|38|False|False|ReasoningSentence|All of this evidence indicates that the Veteran's current acquired psychiatric disorder is the result of or a continuation of the disorders he had in service.
2425|2425|1534347P39S1|1534347|1|39|True|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, resolving all reasonable doubt in favor of the claim, service connection is warranted for the Veteran's acquired psychiatric disorder.

2574|2574|1554166P47S1|1554166|1|47|True|False|FindingSentence|At the outset, the Board points out that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD during the pendency of the claim and the record does not contain a recent diagnosis of disability prior to the Veteran's filing of a claim.

2578|2578|1554166P47S5|1554166|5|47|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, despite these notations, there is no indication in the record that the Veteran has ever been diagnosed with PTSD by a VA or private clinician, nor was he diagnosed with PTSD by the VA psychologist who conducted the March 2015 examination.
2579|2579|1554166P48S1|1554166|1|48|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Conversely, review of the record reveals that the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including:  unspecified depressive disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), personality disorder NOS, and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.
2580|2580|1554166P48S2|1554166|2|48|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the first requirement for establishing service connection, a current disability, has been met.

2592|2592|1554166P51S1|1554166|1|51|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached.

2597|2597|1554166P52S3|1554166|3|52|False|False|ReasoningSentence|In this regard, the diagnosis and etiology of psychiatric disorders are matters not capable of lay observation, and require medical expertise to determine.
2598|2598|1554166P52S4|1554166|4|52|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Accordingly, his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence.
2599|2599|1554166P52S5|1554166|5|52|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.
2600|2600|1554166P53S1|1554166|1|53|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran's drug abuse history.
2601|2601|1554166P53S2|1554166|2|53|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, both 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.301(a) and 3.301(d) prohibit service connection for diseases incurred during active military service resulting from the abuse of drugs.
2602|2602|1554166P53S3|1554166|3|53|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As any disease resulting from his abuse of illegal drugs is not considered to be in the line of duty pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.301(d), service connection for a depressive disorder as a result of illegal drug use in service cannot be established.
2603|2603|1554166P53S4|1554166|4|53|False|False|CitationSentence|38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.301(a).
2604|2604|1554166P54S1|1554166|1|54|True|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the Board finds that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders arose in service or are etiologically related to service or any incidents therein.
2605|2605|1554166P54S2|1554166|2|54|False|False|FindingSentence|Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with a psychosis within a year of his separation from service.
2606|2606|1554166P54S3|1554166|3|54|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
2607|2607|1554166P55S1|1554166|1|55|True|False|ReasoningSentence|In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
2608|2608|1554166P55S2|1554166|2|55|False|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.

2650|2650|1554166P48S1|1554166|1|48|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Conversely, review of the record reveals that the Veteran has been diagnosed with several acquired psychiatric disorders other than PTSD including:  unspecified depressive disorder, major depression, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (NOS), personality disorder NOS, and substance abuse disorders, in sustained remission.
2651|2651|1554166P48S2|1554166|2|48|False|False|FindingSentence|Thus, the first requirement for establishing service connection, a current disability, has been met.

2661|2661|1554166P50S4|1554166|4|50|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner also noted the Veteran's reports of being fearful in service and his unverified stressor of seeing a fellow sailor fall overboard.

2663|2663|1554166P51S1|1554166|1|51|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds that the opinion of the VA examiner provided after reviewing the claims file and examining the Veteran is highly probative as it reflects consideration of all relevant facts and the examiner provided a detailed rationale for the conclusion reached.

2669|2669|1554166P52S4|1554166|4|52|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Accordingly, his opinion as to the diagnosis or etiology of the current psychiatric symptomology is not competent medical evidence.
2670|2670|1554166P52S5|1554166|5|52|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds the opinion of the VA examiner to be significantly more probative than his lay assertions.
2671|2671|1554166P53S1|1554166|1|53|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Moreover, the Board recognizes that the Veteran reported at his March 2015 examination and elsewhere that he began abusing drugs during service and that the examiner attributed his current depressive symptoms to the Veteran's drug abuse history.
2672|2672|1554166P53S2|1554166|2|53|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, both 38 C.F.R. Â§Â§ 3.301(a) and 3.301(d) prohibit service connection for diseases incurred during active military service resulting from the abuse of drugs.
2673|2673|1554166P53S3|1554166|3|53|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As any disease resulting from his abuse of illegal drugs is not considered to be in the line of duty pursuant to 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.301(d), service connection for a depressive disorder as a result of illegal drug use in service cannot be established.

2675|2675|1554166P54S1|1554166|1|54|True|False|FindingSentence|In summary, the Board finds that the preponderance of the probative evidence is against a finding that the Veteran's diagnosed acquired psychiatric disorders arose in service or are etiologically related to service or any incidents therein.
2676|2676|1554166P54S2|1554166|2|54|False|False|FindingSentence|Additionally, there is no evidence that the Veteran was diagnosed with a psychosis within a year of his separation from service.
2677|2677|1554166P54S3|1554166|3|54|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the claim for service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include PTSD, is denied.
2678|2678|1554166P55S1|1554166|1|55|True|False|ReasoningSentence|In reaching the above conclusion, the Board has considered the applicability of the benefit of the doubt doctrine.
2679|2679|1554166P55S2|1554166|2|55|False|False|FindingSentence|However, as the preponderance of the evidence is against the Veteran's claim, that doctrine is not applicable in the instant appeal.

2851|2851|1554465P65S3|1554465|3|65|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The criteria for diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder was not met, the examiner concluded, because it was not clear that she ever had a distinct period of two weeks when the psychotic symptoms persisted but she was free of mood symptoms.
2852|2852|1554465P65S4|1554465|4|65|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner opined, in essence, that no current psychiatric disorder was linked to the Veteran's service or any incident thereof.
2853|2853|1554465P65S5|1554465|5|65|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinion is well reasoned and provides an accurate summary of the record.
2854|2854|1554465P65S6|1554465|6|65|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The opinion is persuasive evidence against the claim.
2855|2855|1554465P66S1|1554465|1|66|True|False|EvidenceSentence|A January 2003 VA PTSD outpatient report noted that the Veteran discussed several motor vehicle accidents in which she was involved.
2856|2856|1554465P66S2|1554465|2|66|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She reported an incident in the military in which she fell from a vehicle and slid 50 feet into an intersection.

2860|2860|1554465P67S2|1554465|2|67|False|False|EvidenceSentence|She has not indicated when or where she was treated for injuries sustained in such a motor vehicle accident in the 10 years since she mentioned such a stressor.
2861|2861|1554465P67S3|1554465|3|67|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran has not provided any additional details which could be used to verify the motor vehicle accident.
2862|2862|1554465P67S4|1554465|4|67|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Thus, the treatment note is unfavorable to the claim, since it is not consistent with any prior information and is not clarified or further described in any later stressor account.
2863|2863|1554465P68S1|1554465|1|68|True|False|EvidenceSentence|SSA awarded the Veteran disability benefits in a favorable 2003 decision.
2864|2864|1554465P68S2|1554465|2|68|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The award letter provides no discussion of a specific stressor or a link between the Veteran's service and an acquired psychiatric disability.
2865|2865|1554465P68S3|1554465|3|68|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This award, and the underlying medical evidence, provides no additional information that is favorable or unfavorable to the claim.
2866|2866|1554465P69S1|1554465|1|69|True|False|EvidenceSentence|An April 2003 VA outpatient note indicates that the award of SSA disability benefits reminded the Veteran of past hardships including being raped, homeless, unemployed, and depressed.
2867|2867|1554465P69S2|1554465|2|69|False|False|EvidenceSentence|This event led to a resurgence of memories associated with the rape, including the name of one of her attackers, T., as well as a woman who later helped protect her from the rapists, E.
2868|2868|1554465P69S3|1554465|3|69|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The social worker who authored the note indicated that memories of her rape appeared to have been the core of the Veteran's current dysphoria.
2869|2869|1554465P70S1|1554465|1|70|True|False|ReasoningSentence|This treatment note raises additional inconsistencies in the information provided by the Veteran.
2870|2870|1554465P70S2|1554465|2|70|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran told the provider she remembered names of two servicemembers involved in the incident, the Veteran has never provided any name of a fellow former servicemember for purposes of development of her claim for compensation.
2871|2871|1554465P70S3|1554465|3|70|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Her statements at the April 2003 VA treatment visit are inconsistent with her actions since that time.
2872|2872|1554465P70S4|1554465|4|70|False|False|ReasoningSentence|That inconsistency undermines her credibility.
2873|2873|1554465P71S1|1554465|1|71|True|False|Sentence|The Board has considered all the evidence of record regarding an alleged sexual assault that the Veteran reports occurred during her active service.
2874|2874|1554465P71S2|1554465|2|71|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The fact that no service department records of the incident have been located does not weigh against the possible occurrence or the Veteran's credibility, since VA regulations recognize that such incidents, if reported, were not uniformly documented.
2875|2875|1554465P71S3|1554465|3|71|False|False|EvidenceSentence|However, in the October 2003 stressor statement, the Veteran stated that she could not remember the names of any individuals involved.
2876|2876|1554465P71S4|1554465|4|71|False|False|ReasoningSentence|That report is in conflict with the April 2003 treatment report.
2877|2877|1554465P72S1|1554465|1|72|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran contends that she had symptoms of a psychiatric disability soon after her discharge from active duty and soon after reserve service was completed.
2878|2878|1554465P72S2|1554465|2|72|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Veteran is competent to report events during active service.
2879|2879|1554465P72S3|1554465|3|72|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|However, once evidence is determined to be competent, the Board must determine whether such evidence is also credible.
2880|2880|1554465P72S4|1554465|4|72|False|False|CitationSentence|"See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994) (distinguishing between competency (""a legal concept determining whether testimony may be heard and considered"") and credibility (""a factual determination going to the probative value of the evidence to be made after the evidence has been admitted"")."
2881|2881|1554465P72S5|1554465|5|72|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The evidence of record contradicts the Veteran's assertion of chronic psychiatric symptoms or disability or symptoms or disability due to psychosis during a presumptive period.
2882|2882|1554465P73S1|1554465|1|73|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|In weighing credibility, VA may consider interest, bias, inconsistent statements, bad character, internal inconsistency, facial plausibility, self-interest, consistency with other evidence of record, malingering, desire for monetary gain, and demeanor of the witness.

2884|2884|1554465P73S3|1554465|3|73|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board may weigh the absence of contemporaneous medical evidence against the lay evidence in determining credibility, but the Board cannot determine that lay evidence lacks credibility merely because it is unaccompanied by contemporaneous medical evidence.

2886|2886|1554465P74S1|1554465|1|74|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|The Board may not ignore a veteran's testimony simply because he or she is an interested party and stands to gain monetary benefits; personal interest may, however, affect the credibility of the evidence.

2889|2889|1554465P74S4|1554465|4|74|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Given the inconsistencies between the Veteran's reports and the objective evidence of record, the Veteran's credibility is diminished.
2890|2890|1554465P75S1|1554465|1|75|True|False|Sentence|The Veteran's service personnel records are associated with the claims file.
2891|2891|1554465P75S2|1554465|2|75|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Review of the service personnel records shows no indication of disciplinary actions, adverse personnel actions, drop in performance, or requests for reassignment.
2892|2892|1554465P75S3|1554465|3|75|False|False|EvidenceSentence|During active service she states that she was awarded the outstanding recruit award, her August 1969 performance evaluation was excellent.
2893|2893|1554465P76S1|1554465|1|76|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported, at the November 2002 VA examination, that she enjoyed both active service and reserve service.
2894|2894|1554465P76S2|1554465|2|76|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran reported that she chose to be discharged from active service in August 1969 due in part to the sexual abuse, but her performance obviously did not deteriorate in any way due to the alleged assault.
2895|2895|1554465P76S3|1554465|3|76|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Importantly, in August 1969, just three months after the alleged sexual assault occurred in May 1969, the Veteran received an excellent performance review.
2896|2896|1554465P77S1|1554465|1|77|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran enlisted in 1983 for six additional years of reserve service and was promoted.

2898|2898|1554465P77S3|1554465|3|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It reflects only high achievement and excellent work ethic.
2899|2899|1554465P77S4|1554465|4|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Significantly, VA outpatient treatment records from 2000 and 2001 do not contain any allegation of any kind of military sexual trauma or abuse.
2900|2900|1554465P77S5|1554465|5|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002, after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
2901|2901|1554465P77S6|1554465|6|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, prior to August 2002, the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors, to include the helicopter crash, seeing dead bodies, and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam.
2902|2902|1554465P77S7|1554465|7|77|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This is not necessarily significant in and of itself, yet, combined with the other credibility evidence of record; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.
2903|2903|1554465P78S1|1554465|1|78|True|False|EvidenceSentence|The Veteran was referred to the VA Mental Health Clinic in September 2002 following a positive military sexual trauma and PTSD screening.
2904|2904|1554465P78S2|1554465|2|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was at that time she was diagnosed with PTSD due to the military sexual trauma.
2905|2905|1554465P78S3|1554465|3|78|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In contrast, the VA psychiatrist who conducted November 2002 VA examination, two months later, concluded that the Veteran did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.
2906|2906|1554465P78S4|1554465|4|78|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board also points out that the examiner had access to and reviewed the Veteran's claims file, to include her prior psychiatric diagnoses, hallucinations, and alleged stressors.
2907|2907|1554465P78S5|1554465|5|78|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As noted above, the November 2012 VA examination report is lengthy, accurate, and provides the reasoning for the examiner's conclusions.
2908|2908|1554465P78S6|1554465|6|78|False|False|ReasoningSentence|In contrast, the VA psychologist who provided the September 2002 diagnosis did not reference review of any records, but, rather, assigned a diagnosis based upon the Veteran's account of her own history.
2909|2909|1554465P79S1|1554465|1|79|True|False|ReasoningSentence|Also probative regarding the Veteran's credibility is the fact that she has told different examiners different facts regarding her history.
2910|2910|1554465P79S2|1554465|2|79|False|False|EvidenceSentence|At the November 2002 VA exam, she stated that in 1987 approximately she started feeling depressed.

2912|2912|1554465P80S1|1554465|1|80|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The various psychiatrists and psychologists who have noted PTSD as due to military sexual trauma appear to have done so based only on the Veteran's self-reported history, rather than review of the complete record.
2913|2913|1554465P80S2|1554465|2|80|False|False|LegalRuleSentence|A medical professional's opinion based on a post-service examination of a veteran is not competent evidence that an in-service stressor occurred.

2915|2915|1554465P81S1|1554465|1|81|True|False|ReasoningSentence|To the degree that the medical providers have based their opinions on the Veteran's self-reported accounts of military sexual trauma, the Board has found such reports to be not credible, and it follows that medical opinions based on such reports are not probative.
2916|2916|1554465P81S2|1554465|2|81|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Further, because such medical opinions are not based on review of the evidence they do not constitute verification of military sexual trauma under 38 C.F.R. Â§ 3.304(f)(4).
2917|2917|1554465P82S1|1554465|1|82|True|False|ReasoningSentence|As a layperson, the Veteran can certainly provide an account of her symptoms and feelings at any given time.
2918|2918|1554465P82S2|1554465|2|82|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, service personnel records, and later reserve service records in particular, weigh heavily against the Veteran's September 2002 account that she has had mental health problems ever since her active service.
2919|2919|1554465P82S3|1554465|3|82|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As mentioned previously, the stellar performance evaluation reports during her reserve service generally negate the contention that mental health problems, such as psychosis, were present at that time.
2920|2920|1554465P83S1|1554465|1|83|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In addition, the Veteran has claimed that her PTSD is a result of a stressor involving her witnessing and picking up human remains of Marines who had been killed in a helicopter crash in Camp Pendleton.
2921|2921|1554465P83S2|1554465|2|83|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This stressor is a major event, yet remains unverified after all attempts.
2922|2922|1554465P84S1|1554465|1|84|True|False|Sentence|While the case was on remand status following the 2009 Remand from the Board, the RO was instructed to accomplish all development action in order to corroborate the stressor.
2923|2923|1554465P84S2|1554465|2|84|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The RO acquired a Command Chronology from the Commanding General, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California from July 1968 through December 1968; no helicopter crash was reported.
2924|2924|1554465P85S1|1554465|1|85|True|False|EvidenceSentence|"The Veteran then provided statements indicating that, during her reserve service, in 1990, she performed post-crash duties at the site of a helicopter crash in which two female Marines were ""torn to pieces."""
2925|2925|1554465P85S2|1554465|2|85|False|False|ReasoningSentence|No objective confirmation of this stressor has been located.
2926|2926|1554465P85S3|1554465|3|85|False|False|ReasoningSentence|It is not credible that a helicopter crash in 1990 which resulted in fatalities would not have been documented by the service department or the base at which it is alleged to have occurred, or that no other information, such as a newspaper article, reports of aviation accidents, or the like, would be located.
2927|2927|1554465P86S1|1554465|1|86|True|False|ReasoningSentence|The Board finds it very probative that the Veteran has described vividly remembering witnessing a crash involving either 2 (October 2004 VA outpatient records), 8 (November 2002 VA examination), or 13 (October 2000 VA Mental Health Clinic outpatient records, Addendum) dead Marines, to include her roommates, yet there is no objective confirmation of the event.
2928|2928|1554465P86S2|1554465|2|86|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"In particular, the Board notes the Veteran's statements that ""the media"" reported on this crash, but their reports were inaccurate."
2929|2929|1554465P87S1|1554465|1|87|True|False|ReasoningSentence|"If the alleged incident had been reported in ""the media,"" as the Veteran has described, it would be expected that objective information about the incident could be located on the Internet, if not from the service department."

2931|2931|1554465P87S3|1554465|3|87|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The absence of any objective corroboration of the alleged helicopter crash with fatalities is highly unfavorable to the Veteran's contention that she picked up human remains following such an accident.

2934|2934|1554465P88S3|1554465|3|88|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The pursuit of this claim for the 15 years of the pendency of this appeal establishes that the Veteran sincerely believes that a current psychiatric disorder is linked to her service.
2935|2935|1554465P89S1|1554465|1|89|True|False|FindingSentence|Nevertheless, the preponderance of the evidence is unfavorable to the claim.

2939|2939|1554465P90S2|1554465|2|90|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was concluded that exhaustive attempts failed to corroborate a stressor and no further development should be conducted.
2940|2940|1554465P90S3|1554465|3|90|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Although the Veteran suggests that it is possible that this crash may have occurred shortly after the Veteran was called up on reserve duty after Desert Storm began in 1991, there simply is no record of 2, 8, or 13 Marines perishing in a helicopter accident at Camp Pendleton at that time either.

2943|2943|1554465P91S2|1554465|2|91|False|False|FindingSentence|However, there is no indication in the record whatsoever that depressive disorder with psychotic features is related to her service.
2944|2944|1554465P92S1|1554465|1|92|True|False|FindingSentence|In sum, the Board is not authorized to grant service connection for PTSD, because the Veteran has not presented verified or verifiable stressors.

3169|3169|1554465P77S5|1554465|5|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The first evidence of a report of military sexual trauma is from August 2002, after the Veteran filed her claim for entitlement to service connection for PTSD.
3170|3170|1554465P77S6|1554465|6|77|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Notably, prior to August 2002, the Veteran specifically alleged other stressors, to include the helicopter crash, seeing dead bodies, and generalized nightmares about people she knew who may have died serving in Vietnam.
3171|3171|1554465P77S7|1554465|7|77|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This is not necessarily significant in and of itself, yet, combined with the other credibility evidence of record; the Board finds that it diminishes her credibility somewhat in that her descriptions regarding her stressors have changed at various examinations.

3576|3576|1607479P74S2|1607479|2|74|False|False|FindingSentence|As such, the Veteran is presumed sound at service entrance.
3577|3577|1607479P74S3|1607479|3|74|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Regarding whether the presumption of soundness may be rebutted in this case, the July 2014 VA examiner opined that the records suggest that the Veteran's mental health issues stem from the sexual, physical and emotional abuse as a child.

3718|3718|1608262P48S2|1608262|2|48|False|False|ReasoningSentence|However, while the representative pointed out several symptoms that the representative felt might be indicative of the onset of an anxiety disorder, the fact remains that there is no medical evidence of record endorsing the representative's suggestions.
3719|3719|1608262P48S3|1608262|3|48|False|False|ReasoningSentence|This is highly relevant in that the representative has not been shown to have the medical training or expertise to link in-service symptoms to a current psychiatric diagnosis.

3723|3723|1608262P48S7|1608262|7|48|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, the representative's statement does not establish service connection and does not trigger the duty to assist.
3724|3724|1608262P49S1|1608262|1|49|True|False|ReasoningSentence|As discussed, the medical evidence is squarely against the suggestions that the Veteran's anxiety disorder had its onset in service or within a year of service discharge or is otherwise etiologically related to service.
3725|3725|1608262P49S2|1608262|2|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|The record contains no evidence of any mental health symptoms in service, at discharge, and after his separation from service until he started treating for substance abuse in 2004 (as explained by the VA examiner following an extensive claims file review).
3726|3726|1608262P49S3|1608262|3|49|False|False|ReasoningSentence|There is also no competent medical opinion of record which relates the Veteran's anxiety disorder to his service.

3730|3730|1608262P50S1|1608262|1|50|True|False|LegalRuleSentence|While the Veteran was diagnosed with personality disorder, service connection may not be awarded for personality disorders.

3732|3732|1608262P51S1|1608262|1|51|True|False|ReasoningSentence|As a lay person, the Veteran is competent to report what comes to him through his senses, but he lacks the medical training and expertise to provide a complex medical opinion as to the etiology of an anxiety disorder.
3733|3733|1608262P51S2|1608262|2|51|False|False|CitationSentence|See Layno v. Brown, 6 Vet. App. 465 (1994), Jandreau v. Nicholson, 492 F. 3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

3735|3735|1608262P51S4|1608262|4|51|False|False|ReasoningSentence|Therefore, while the Veteran disagrees with the conclusion that his anxiety disorder neither began during, nor was otherwise caused by, his military service, he is not considered competent (meaning medical qualified) to address the etiology of his psychiatric disorder.
3736|3736|1608262P51S5|1608262|5|51|False|False|ReasoningSentence|As such, his opinion is insufficient to provide the requisite nexus.
3737|3737|1608262P52S1|1608262|1|52|True|False|FindingSentence|In summary, as the evidence is against the claim, service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability is not warranted.

4038|4038|1630402P28S4|1630402|4|28|False|False|EvidenceSentence|The examiner stated that there was insufficient evidence to diagnose PTSD due to no history of treatment or evidence of PTSD symptoms prior to dementia onset and the Veteran's inability to meaningfully participate in a clinical interview.
4039|4039|1630402P29S1|1630402|1|29|True|False|EvidenceSentence|In contrast, a private psychiatrist, Dr. M.B., opined in May 2013 that it is much more likely than not that the alleged stressor events contributed directly to the occurrence of severe, chronic, delayed onset posttraumatic stress disorder in the Veteran's case.
4040|4040|1630402P29S2|1630402|2|29|False|False|EvidenceSentence|In reaching this conclusion, Dr. B. initially noted that the Veteran demonstrated well the required clinical criteria to establish the diagnosis severe PTSD, chronic, delayed onset, in accordance with the DSM-IV, since 2007 to the present, based on his investigations and interviews, including family, fellow veteran combat swimmers, other foreign war veterans, health care team and other Navy diving medicine experts.

4043|4043|1630402P30S2|1630402|2|30|False|False|EvidenceSentence|This ingrained compartmentalization usually persists for years as a part of the diver's personality long after a Navy diving career is completed. . . .
4044|4044|1630402P30S3|1630402|3|30|False|False|EvidenceSentence|Diver's psychological defenses are adaptively hardened from years of unexpected exposures to traumatic experiences; however, many years later, they can develop PTSD replaying and reliving in dramatic fashion those situations which caused physical injury intense fear and anxiety of being ambushed or coming under fire and grief over seeing and swimming among bodies and body parts of fellow divers.
4045|4045|1630402P30S4|1630402|4|30|False|False|EvidenceSentence|This exactly describes what happened in [the Veteran's] life.

4048|4048|1630402P30S7|1630402|7|30|False|False|EvidenceSentence|It was only until his brain expected aging in later life caused both structural brain decline as well as the decline of those ingrained psychological defenses; in 2007, this led to the beginning of a flooding of emotional responses to past wartime horrors.
4049|4049|1630402P30S8|1630402|8|30|False|False|EvidenceSentence|He has replayed these situations over and over in public and in front of his health care providers at the Perry Point Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) as well as in the presence of his family members at home and at reunions of wartime combat and special warfare swimmers.
4050|4050|1630402P31S1|1630402|1|31|True|False|EvidenceSentence|Email correspondence dated April 2013 between Dr. B and another physician reflects that they agreed that PTSD best described the Veteran's behavior which deluded him into thinking that the metal hair clamps of a female in the hospital hallway were improvised explosive devices which must be disarmed and made safe and he must protect the hospital and those in it from injury by enemy forces landing on the river bank and attacking.
4051|4051|1630402P32S1|1630402|1|32|True|False|EvidenceSentence|"Dr. B. also reviewed the January 2012 VA examination report and pointed out that this determination was based upon the Veteran's lack of cooperation during one brief interview of several questions, to which he responded ""Ask my wife,"" but his wife was not allowed to provide information at this examination."
4052|4052|1630402P32S2|1630402|2|32|False|False|EvidenceSentence|"It was further noted that the Veteran's brief singular responses were actually direct manifestations of PTSD; avoidance of stimuli (conversation) that recall/relive the traumatic events; suspicious ness of a strange individual; and misperception that he was being interrogated by ""an enemy soldier"" in a POW situation and not cooperating to provide information which could betray his men and cause them harm and torture."
4053|4053|1630402P33S1|1630402|1|33|True|False|FindingSentence|Thus, there is evidence of record that indicates that the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his alleged combat stressors in service.
4054|4054|1630402P33S2|1630402|2|33|False|False|FindingSentence|Based on the foregoing, the Board finds that the evidence is at least in equipoise regarding whether the Veteran has a current diagnosis of PTSD related to his claimed in-service combat stressors.
4055|4055|1630402P33S3|1630402|3|33|False|False|FindingSentence|Accordingly, the Board resolves any reasonable doubt in the Veteran's favor and finds service connection for PTSD is warranted.
